You will need to collaborate with other agents by delegating them tasks inlvoving their expertise and communicate with them. To start your task, your should first draft a high-level plan with a list of steps,concisely describing how you will approach the task. Then, execute the plan.  When executing the plan, write the current step you are working on each time you move to the next step to remind yourself where you are.  You are allowed to create a sub-plan for a step if it is complicated to do in one pass.\nOptionally, it may be helpful to share a plan with other agents to help guide them in some cases.\n  Depending on the task, you may need to do multiple rounds of communications, delegations of tasks and receiving suggestions to make sure you have all the necessary information for the final review; you should arrange follow up delegations or communication to other agents if they provide a bad response or seem to have misunderstood the task.These include asking follow-up questions, clarifying your requests, or engaging in additional discussion to fully reason about the task.\n To reduce communication errors, after you send a message you should write a short description of what you expect the response to look like.  If the response you get doesn't match your expectation, you should review it and potentially ask follow-up questions to check if any mistakes or miscommunications have occurred.  It could be the case that an agent (including yourself) has misread something or made a logic error.Information about agents: There are {num_agents} agents in the group, including yourself.

VERY IMPORTANT: Make sure to only draft the high-level plan for the review once at the begining, avoiding genreating duplicate messages.",
        "task_prompt": "Task: Write a list of feedback comments, similar to the suggestions a reivewer might make. In addition, focus on major comments rather than minor comments; major coments are important things that affect the overall impact of the paper, whereas minor comments are small things like style/grammar or small details that don't matter for whether the paper should be accpeted to a venue. \n Be specifci in your suggestions, including details about method or resource names and any particular steps tha authors should follow. However, don't suggest things that have already been included or addressed in the paper. Remeber that you can collarate if necessary. If you write some comments and ask for additional ones, you may want provide your original comments so that the agent knows where they are. \n  Your review comments should be specific and express an appropriate level of importance. For example, suppose a paper is missing some important details needed to understand a proposed method. A comment like 'the authors could add more details about the proposd method, such as XYZ.' is bad because it is too generic; even for a paper with a good method descrption it is always possible to add more deails, so it isn't clear if there is acutally a significant problem with the current paper. Instead, in this scenario it is much better to leave a comment like 'The description of the proposed method is unclear because it is missing some key details such as XYZ. Without these details it is hard to know wheter ___.' Make sure your high-level plan mentions this instruction. \n Some comments are a matter of degree. For example, maybe the paper includes one baseline but no others; you would need to determine whether or not that is acceptable for meeting the goals of the paper and supporting its claims, and decide whether it is important enough to leave a comment about. You can discuss with other agents as needed to help determine this. \n You will need to communicate with other agents to understand the paper and learn what has already been addressed and what is still missing from the paper. \n The main type of feedback you should focus on the thoroughness of the experimetns and consistency of claims. You should ensure that information is consistent acrsos the paper and that claims are appropriately supported by evidence. You high-level plan should be roughly as follows: \n 1. Identify paper's main goals, contributions, and claims by going through the paper paragraph by paragraph. 2. Identify expectations for fulfilling the goals and claims. Collaborate with experiment_agent in this part. Delegate the experiment_agent to come up with a clear description of the experimetns, analyses, ablations or alternative methods used that you would use to verify the paper'sclaims if you were doing the study yourself. Be specific and detailed in your description; what experiments should be conducted, how should they be set up and why are they helpful for verifying the claims. 3. Check if the paper mathces your expectations. a. Go through the actual evaluations and experiments in the paper and identify the similarities and differences between them and your experiment description. Make sure to pay close attention to details. b. For each way the paper's experiments don't match your expectations, determine if this constitutes a shortcoming of the paper, or if the paper's experiments/methodology still fulfils the goals and claims of the paper. It is helpful to share your thoughts and delegate the experimetns_agent to give it's opinion. c. If the paper's experiments or methodology are suboptimal or inadequate, write a feedback explaining the shortcomings and what the authors should do to resolve the issue. Be detailed and specific in your feedback to make it clear what the authors should do and why the suggestion is important. 4. Come up with a logical, step-by-step sub plan to delegate the clarity and impact agents to collaborate with you to refine your feedbacks regarding the clarity and impact of the paper. 5. Generate detailed, constructive feedback on shortcomings and areas for improvement. 6. Compile comprehensive review synthesizing all analyses and agent inputs. You should use {paper_read_tool} to read the paper at first and use {paper_search_tool} to retrieve relevant content later. 7.presenrt the final review/comments to all the expert agents to ask them to provide feedbacks on your comments for potential revision of the review, and revise the final review accordingly. Make sure to delegates others agents to provide feedbacks on their area of expertise and the delegations should stick to your high-level plan. "
