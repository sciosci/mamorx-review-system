{'existing_title': 'Attention-based multimodal contextual fusion for sentiment and emotion classification using bidirectional LSTM', 'assessment': "Decision: Not Novel\n\nJustification: Both papers focus on using LSTM models for multimodal sentiment analysis in videos, with an emphasis on contextual relationships between utterances. The new paper's approach of using LSTM to capture contextual information from surrounding utterances appears very similar to the existing paper's use of bidirectional LSTM for contextual fusion. Without more details on the specific methodologies, the new paper does not seem to present a significantly novel approach compared to the existing work."}
{'existing_title': 'Multi-level context extraction and attention-based contextual inter-modal fusion for multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion classification', 'assessment': "Decision: Novel\n\nJustification: While both papers address multimodal sentiment analysis, the new paper specifically proposes an LSTM-based model to capture contextual relationships among utterances within a video, which appears to be a novel approach. The existing paper's title suggests a focus on multi-level context extraction and inter-modal fusion, but without an abstract to compare, it's difficult to determine the exact overlap. Given the specific focus on utterance interdependencies in the new paper and the claimed improvement over state-of-the-art results, it seems to present a sufficiently novel contribution to the field."}
{'existing_title': 'Multi‚Äêlevel feature optimization and multimodal contextual fusion for sentiment analysis and emotion classification', 'assessment': 'Decision: Not Novel\n\nJustification: Both papers focus on multimodal sentiment analysis using LSTM-based models to capture contextual information between utterances in videos. The existing paper already addresses the key ideas presented in the new paper, including feature optimization, contextual fusion, and the use of bidirectional LSTM for extracting relationships between neighboring utterances. While the new paper claims a slightly higher improvement over the state of the art (5-10% vs. 3-6%), this alone does not constitute a significantly novel approach or idea compared to the existing work.'}
{'existing_title': 'Attention-based word-level contextual feature extraction and cross-modality fusion for sentiment analysis and emotion classification', 'assessment': 'Decision: Not Novel\n\nJustification: Both papers focus on multimodal sentiment analysis using LSTM-based models to capture contextual information among utterances in videos. The existing paper already addresses the issue of contextual relationships between utterances using bidirectional LSTM, which is very similar to the proposed approach in the new paper. While the new paper claims improvement in performance, it does not present a significantly novel methodology or approach compared to the existing work, which already incorporates sophisticated techniques like attention mechanisms and cross-modality fusion.'}
{'existing_title': 'Multimodal Video Sentiment Analysis Using Audio and Text Data', 'assessment': "Decision: Novel\n\nJustification: While both papers address multimodal sentiment analysis in videos, the new paper introduces a novel approach by modeling contextual relationships among utterances using an LSTM-based model. This is a significant departure from the existing paper, which treats utterances independently and focuses on separate audio and text analysis. The new paper's emphasis on inter-dependencies between utterances and its reported improvement over state-of-the-art methods suggest a meaningful advancement in the field."}
{'existing_title': 'Affect-GCN: a multimodal graph convolutional network for multi-emotion with intensity recognition and sentiment analysis in dialogues', 'assessment': "Decision: Novel\n\nJustification: The new paper proposes an LSTM-based model that considers contextual relationships among utterances in multimodal sentiment analysis, which is a novel approach compared to treating utterances as independent entities. While both papers deal with multimodal sentiment analysis, the new paper's focus on inter-dependencies between utterances and the use of LSTM for capturing contextual information appears to be a distinct and innovative contribution to the field. The lack of an abstract for the existing paper makes a detailed comparison difficult, but based on the titles alone, the approaches seem sufficiently different to consider the new paper novel."}
{'existing_title': 'Multi-Attention Multimodal Sentiment Analysis', 'assessment': "Decision: Not Novel\n\nJustification: Both papers focus on multimodal sentiment analysis using contextual information among utterances, with the existing paper already employing a more sophisticated approach using multi-attention mechanisms and BiGRU. The new paper's proposed LSTM-based model to capture contextual information does not appear to offer significant novelty over the existing work's BiGRU with dual attention layers. While the new paper claims improvement over state-of-the-art, it doesn't present a fundamentally new approach or insight that isn't already addressed in the existing, more comprehensive study."}
{'existing_title': 'Highlight Timestamp Detection Model for Comedy Videos via Multimodal Sentiment Analysis', 'assessment': "Decision: Novel\n\nJustification: While both papers address multimodal sentiment analysis in videos, the new paper focuses specifically on modeling contextual relationships among utterances using an LSTM-based approach. This is a distinct and more targeted method compared to the existing paper, which presents a broader overview of multimodal structures for video understanding. The new paper's emphasis on inter-dependencies between utterances and its reported improvement over state-of-the-art results suggest a novel contribution to the field."}
{'existing_title': 'Multimodal Sentiment Analysis using Speech Signals with Machine Learning Techniques', 'assessment': "Decision: Novel\n\nJustification: While both papers address multimodal sentiment analysis, the new paper proposes a significantly different approach by focusing on inter-utterance relationships using an LSTM model. This contrasts with the existing paper's hybrid CNN-BLSTM approach and feature selection methods. The new paper's emphasis on contextual information among utterances represents a novel perspective in the field, potentially offering improved performance and generalizability not addressed in the existing work."}
{'existing_title': 'Neural Networks and Emotions: A Deep Learning Perspective', 'assessment': "Decision: Novel\n\nJustification: While both papers address emotion analysis using deep learning techniques, the new paper specifically focuses on modeling contextual relationships among utterances in multimodal sentiment analysis of videos. This approach, using LSTM to capture inter-dependencies between utterances, is not present in the existing paper, which treats different modalities separately. The new paper's emphasis on context and its reported improvement over state-of-the-art results suggest a novel contribution to the field of multimodal sentiment analysis."}
