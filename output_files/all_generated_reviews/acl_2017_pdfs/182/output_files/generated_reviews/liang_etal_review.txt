Review outline:

1. Significance and novelty

2. Potential reasons for acceptance

3. Potential reasons for rejection
- Lack of strong empirical validation
  • Limited datasets used (only 3)
  • No ablation studies or sensitivity analysis presented
- Insufficient comparison to state-of-the-art
  • Only compared to 2 baseline methods
  • No comparison to more recent deep learning approaches for multimodal sentiment analysis
- Questionable generalizability 
  • Person-independent setup but small number of speakers
  • Cross-lingual experiment shows poor performance
- Lack of theoretical grounding
  • No formal analysis of why LSTM is suitable for capturing inter-utterance dependencies
  • No discussion of limitations of proposed approach

4. Suggestions for improvement
- Conduct more extensive experiments
- Provide stronger empirical comparisons 
- Analyze generalizability more rigorously
- Strengthen theoretical foundations
