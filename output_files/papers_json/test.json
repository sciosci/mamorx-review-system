We additionally find that by including aspect-specific \"expert\" GPT agents to separately assist with generating comments on experiments, clarity, and impact, the method can perform significantly better than when having a lone agent attempt to generate all types of feedback at once; we refer to this specialized variant of our method as MARG-S.",

In addition, we found that while users perceived the majority of the comments generated by the baselines as being generic, the vast ma-jority (71%) of MARG-S's comments were rated as specific.

While these are useful tools, they are limited in scope compared to the breadth of feedback authors receive from a real review; our work aims to produce free-form textual review comments across a variety of aspects. Past work on automatic review generation primarily does so using (relatively) small models that cannot consume the full text of a paper (Yuan and Liu, 2022) or use template-filling instead of generating nuanced free-form comments (Wang et al., 2020a) . More recent work has explored using GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) to verify author checklists (Liu and Shah, 2023) , but this limits the variety in generated comment types.",

The leader agent is given a protocol with which it can broadcast a message to all other agents and receive responses.

Surprisingly, these \"obvious\" errors were often not trivial for the system to recognize, making the altered papers useful for finding and mitigating blind-spots.

We use a single agent to generate all comments for the paper, but we use a more sophisticated prompt (subsection A.3) that is designed to encourage the model to generate more specific and actionable comments. As with the other simple baseline, we generate comments independently for each paper chunk and then merge the resulting lists with GPT. Similarly to our multi-agent method, we include a refinement step in this baseline. For each paper chunk, we give the model the chunk and the final list of comments, and ask it to output a new, refined list of comments. This provides an opportunity to remove incorrect comments that arise from the independent processing of each chunk. For example, if one chunk contains the introduction but not the experiments, the model might initially write a comment that claims the experiments are missing, but in the refinement stage will be able to prune it when it sees the chunk that does contain experiments.",

Of course, we still must include some instructions that explain the communication protocol and instruct the agents to work together, but the task prompt includes all the same language as in the single-agent setting.

The prompt used in Liang et al. (2023) instructs the model to generate an \"outline\" style review, and includes non-actionable positive comments. Fortunately, when comparing their method's comments with real reviews, they developed a prompt to extract and merge the parts of an outline that focus on \"criticisms\" and to ignore minor grammar comments.

The experiment-focused model does well considering the small number of comments it produces, but as it produces half as many comments as the impact model it also has half the recall. Finally, the clarity-focused model struggles compared to the other two. The poor performance of the clarity model may be due in part to the subjective nature of clarity judgements and the fact that language models do not necessarily perceive text in the same way that humans do (e.g., humans prefer that terms be defined before they are used, but a model that consumes a full document at once might not see a problem if terms are defined later). In addition, we note that due to the fact that the input does not capture visual information such as figures, tables, and the arrangement of symbols in equations, there are many resulting clarity issues that are not present in the full paper, and getting the model to identify the \"real\" issues from among the large number of parsing-and input-format-related issues is challenging. We observe that without the refinement stage, MARG-S's performance is reduced on all metrics, but it still obtains reasonable results; recall remains the second-highest of all methods. Interestingly, the number of generated comments is slightly lower than with the refinement stage, indicating that the refinement stage splits one comment into multiple comments more often than it prunes comments.",

The relatively high fraction of cases where models ignore information is quite interesting and suggests that GPT-4 can still fail in very basic ways, despite the strong results that have been seen in other studies of its reasoning ability.

Finally, while splitting the paper into chunks allows MARG-S to consume papers beyond the base model's input size limits, it is still limited in that very large inputs can result in a large number of messages on each round of communication (one per chunk) which overflow the input; it would be interesting to explore ways to compress or prune messages to further increase the system's effective input capacity.",

                "text": "worker): The main goal of my section of the paper is to describe the method of Directed Graph Clustering (DIGRAC) and its implementation, as well as the experiments conducted to test its efficacy. The paper introduces a self-supervised loss for clustering and a directed mixed path aggregation scheme (DIMPA) to implement DIGRAC. The method aims to find a partition that maximizes the imbalance flow to capture clusters in the meta-graph. The paper also introduces a global probabilistic imbalance score and discusses different variants for selecting pairs of clusters. The DIMPA scheme is used to build node embeddings and obtain the probability assignment matrix. The paper also discusses the experiments conducted to test the efficacy of DIGRAC, using both synthetic and real-world data sets. The performance of DIGRAC is measured using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and accuracy for node clustering, node classification, and link direction prediction. The paper claims that DIGRAC outperforms its competitors, especially when there exist ambient nodes. EXPECTED RESPONSE: Confirmation of receipt and understanding of the summary, and potentially further instructions or questions. Agent 3 (worker): The main goals of my section of the paper are to present the experimental results of the DIGRAC model and to discuss future work and potential improvements. The experimental results show that the DIGRAC model performs well in node clustering tasks, especially when using the \"sort\" loss function and when additional label information is available. The future work section discusses potential improvements to the model, such as semi-supervised learning, automatic detection of the number of clusters, and adaptations for large scale applications. The paper also suggests that the model could be improved by considering more pairwise imbalance scores and by using regularization in sparse settings. Expected response: Confirmation from Agent 0 that my summary is accurate and complete, or requests for additional information or clarification. Agent 4 (expert): I do not believe the request is relevant to me, as I do not have a paper chunk. I will stand by for further instructions. Agent 0 (leader): Step 1b: Compile and filter the responses to create a concise list of the paper's main goals, contributions, and claims. Based on the responses from the agents, the main goals, contributions, and claims of the paper are: 1.

                "text": "expert): Based on the main goals, contributions, and claims of the paper, here are the experiments, analyses, and ablations that would be necessary to verify the paper's claims: 1. **Baseline Comparison**: To validate the effectiveness of the DIGRAC framework, it should be compared with existing state-of-the-art methods for node clustering in directed networks. This comparison should include both traditional methods and other GNN-based methods. The comparison should be done on multiple datasets with varying characteristics to ensure the robustness of the results. 2. **Ablation Study**: To understand the contribution of each component of the DIGRAC framework, an ablation study should be conducted. This involves removing or modifying one component at a time (e.g., the probabilistic imbalance loss, the DIMPA scheme) and observing the impact on the performance. This will help to understand the importance of each component and how they contribute to the overall performance. 3. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Since DIGRAC can naturally incorporate node features, an analysis should be conducted to understand the importance of different features. This can be done by using feature importance methods such as permutation importance or SHAP values. 4. **Scalability Analysis**: To validate the claim that DIGRAC can be adapted for large scale applications, experiments should be conducted on large datasets. The scalability can be evaluated in terms of both computational time and memory usage. 5. **Semi-supervised Learning Experiment**: To validate the potential improvement of semi-supervised learning, experiments should be conducted where a small amount of labeled data is used in addition to the unlabeled data. The performance of the semi-supervised learning approach can be compared with the unsupervised learning approach. 6. **Automatic Cluster Detection Experiment**: To validate the potential improvement of automatic detection of the number of clusters, experiments should be conducted where the number of clusters is not provided as input. The performance of the automatic cluster detection approach can be compared with the approach where the number of clusters is provided. The performance of the methods can be evaluated using standard clustering metrics such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), and F1 score. The statistical significance of the results should be tested using appropriate statistical tests. Agent 0 (leader): Step 3a: Ask each agent to describe the evaluations and experiments conducted in their section of the paper. SEND MESSAGE: Please describe the evaluations and experiments conducted in your section of the paper. Be as specific as possible. Expected response: Each agent should provide a detailed description of the evaluations and experiments conducted in their section of the paper. Agent 1 (worker): My section of the paper does not contain specific details about the evaluations and experiments conducted. It mainly discusses the problem definition, the proposed DIGRAC method, and the self-supervised loss for clustering. However, it does mention that experimental results on synthetic data and real-world data at different scales demonstrate that the method can achieve state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of network densities and topologies. Expected response: Agent 0 should acknowledge the information provided and may ask for further details or clarification if needed. Agent 2 (worker): In my section of the paper, the authors conduct several experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of their proposed method, DIGRAC. Firstly, they use synthetic data generated from Directed Stochastic Block Models (DSBM) with different parameters and structures. They vary the number of clusters,the ratio between the largest and smallest cluster size, the number of nodes, and the direction flip probability. They also consider different meta-graph structures, including \"cycle\", \"path\", \"complete\", and \"star\", with or without ambient nodes. Secondly, they test DIGRAC on five real-world digraph datasets: Telegram, Blog, Migration, WikiTalk, and Lead-Lag. The number of clusters and values of \u03b2 are set differently for each dataset. In terms of performance measures, they use the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) for node clustering, and accuracy for node classification and link direction prediction. They also introduce normalized imbalance scores to evaluate clustering performance based on flow imbalance. Finally, they compare DIGRAC against 11 recent methods from the literature for clustering digraphs, including InfoMap, DGCN, and three variants of DiGCN. The authors also discuss their training setup and hyperparameter selection process. They use 10% of all nodes from each cluster as test nodes, 10% as validation nodes to select the model, and the remaining 80% as training nodes. Hyperparameters are selected via a greedy search. Agent 3 (worker): In my section of the paper, the authors conducted experiments on real-world data sets to evaluate the performance of the DIGRAC model. They used the largest K eigenvectors of the Hermitian matrix to construct an input feature matrix. They tested the model on a DSBM(\"cycle\", T, n = 1000, K = 5, p = 0.02, \u03c1 = 1) model and compared the test ARI performance using three variants of loss functions on the same digraph. They found that the \"sort\" choice performed best among these variants. They also experimented on adding seeds, with the seed ratio defined as the ratio of the number of seed nodes to the number of training nodes. They found that seed nodes with a supervised loss function enhance performance, and inferred that the model can further boost"

The novel probabilistic imbalance loss introduced in the paper is a self-supervised loss function inspired by Cucuringu et al. (2020a). It aims to cluster the nodes by maximizing a normalized form of cut imbalance across clusters. The imbalance flows are normalized to obtain an imbalance score with values in [0, 1] for interpretability and ease of comparison. This loss function is designed to optimize the directed flow imbalance for clustering. It is calculated based on the CI vol_sum from a specific equation mentioned in the paper. This loss function is different from others as it specifically targets the imbalance in the flow of information in the network, which is a unique aspect of directed networks."

Could you please provide the summary so I can start my review? Agent 0 (leader): Apologies for the oversight. Let's correct that. SEND MESSAGE: Here is a summary of the paper: The paper introduces a new method for node clustering in directed networks, called DIGRAC. The motivation behind this method is the observation that directionality in networks can reveal latent properties of network flows and can be a vital signal for directed clustering, even in the absence of any edge density differences. The goal of DIGRAC is to recover clusters with strong and imbalanced flow among them. The method uses a self-supervised loss function for clustering and a directed mixed path aggregation scheme to build node embeddings. The paper also introduces a new measure, the imbalance score, to evaluate clustering performance based on flow imbalance. The key findings presented in the paper are that DIGRAC, which optimizes directed flow imbalance for clustering without requiring label supervision, attains state-of-the-art results on directed graph clustering for a wide range of noise and sparsity levels and graph structures and topologies. The paper also discusses how DIGRAC complements existing approaches and extends its applicability beyond settings where the input data is a digraph.
