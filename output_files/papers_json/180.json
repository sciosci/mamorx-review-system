In this work, we study the task of identifying products being bought and sold in online cybercrime forums, which exhibits particularly challenging cross-domain effects. We formulate a task that represents a hybrid of slot-filling information extraction and named entity recognition and annotate datasets consisting of data from four different forums. Each of these forums constitutes its own \"fine-grained domain\" in that the forums cover different market sectors with different properties, even though all forums are in the broad domain of cybercrime. We characterize these domain differences in the context of a learning-based system: supervised models see decreased accuracy when applied to new forums, and standard techniques for semisupervised learning and domain adaptation have limited effectiveness on this data, which suggests the need to improve these techniques.\nWe release a dataset of 93,924 posts from across 4 forums, with annotations for 1,938 posts.",

One domain for which automated analysis is particularly useful is Internet security: researchers obtain large amounts of text data pertinent to active threats or ongoing cybercriminal activity, for which the ability to rapidly characterize that text and draw conclusions can reap major benefits (Krebs, 2013a,b) . However, conducting automatic analysis is difficult because this data is outof-domain for conventional NLP models, which harms the performance of both discrete models (McClosky et al., 2010) and deep models (Zhang et al., 2017) . Not only that, we show that data from one cybercrime forum is even out of domain with respect to another cybercrime forum, making this data especially challenging.",

Some of these analyses only require post-level information (what is the product being bought or sold in this post?) whereas other analyses might require token-level references; we annotate at the token level to make our annotation as general as possible.

Moreover, because we are operating over forums, the data is substantially messier than classical NER corpora like CoNLL (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) .

Simple binary classification of tokens as product names can be effective, but performance drops off precipitously when a system trained on one forum is applied to a different fo- rum: in this sense, even two different cybercrime forums seem to represent different \"fine-grained domains.\" Since we want to avoid having to annotate data for every new forum that might need to be analyzed, we explore several methods for adaptation, mixing type-level annotation (Garrette and Baldridge, 2013; Garrette et al., 2013) , tokenlevel annotation (Daume III, 2007) , and semisupervised approaches (Turian et al., 2010) . 2 We find little improvement from these methods and discuss why they fail to have a larger impact. Overall, our results characterize the challenges of our fine-grained domain adaptation problem in online marketplace data. We believe that this new dataset provides a useful testbed for additional inquiry and investigation into modeling of finegrained domain differences.",

Our basic annotation principle is to annotate tokens when they are either the product that will be delivered or are an integral part of the method leading to the delivery of that product. For example, in Figure 1 , the fragment mod DCIBot is the core product, but coder is annotated as well, since this person is inextricably linked to the service being provided: the post seeks someone to perform the task. However, the Backconnect bot example is a more straightforward transaction (the human agent is less integral), so only the product is annotated. Verbs may also be annotated, as in the case of hack an account: here hack is the method and the deliverable is the account, so both are annotated.",

This task may be easier than the general tagging problem: for example, if we can effectively identify the product in the title of a post, then we do not need to identify additional references to that product in the body of the post. Therefore, we also consider a post-level model, which directly tries to select one token (or NP) out of a post as the most likely product. Structuring the prediction problem in this way naturally lets the model be more conservative in its extractions and simplifies the task, since highly ambiguous product mentions can be ignored if a clear product mention is present. Put another way, it supplies a form of prior knowledge that can be useful for the task, namely that each post has exactly one product.",

We form Brown clusters on our unlabeled data from both Darkode and Hack Forums (see Table 1 for sizes). We use Liang (2005) 's implementation to learn 50 clusters. 8 Upon inspection, these clusters do indeed capture some of the semantics relevant to the problem: for example, the cluster 110 has as its most frequent members service, account, price, time, crypter, and server, many of which are product-associated nouns.

If we assume the domain transfer problem is more complex, we really want to leverage labeled data in the target domain rather than attempting to transfer features based only on type-level information. Specifically, we are interested in cases where a relatively small number of labeled posts (less than 100) might provide substantial benefit to the adaptation; a researcher could plausibly do this annotation in a few hours. We consider two ways of exploiting labeled target-domain data. The first is to simply take these posts as additional training data. The second is to also employ the \"frustratingly easy\" domain adaptation method of Daume III (2007) . In this framework, each feature fired in our model is actually fired twice: one copy is domaingeneral and one is conjoined with the domain label (here, the name of the forum). 10 Table 5 : Product token OOV rates on development sets (test set for Blackhat and Nulled) of various forums with respect to training on Darkode and Hack Forums. We also show the recall of an NP-level system on seen (R seen ) and OOV (R oov ) tokens. Darkode seems to be more \"general\" than Hack Forums: the Darkode system generally has lower OOV rates and provides more consistent performance on OOV tokens than the Hack Forums system. so, the model should gain some ability to separate domain-general from domain-specific feature values. For both training methods, we upweight the contribution of the target-domain posts in the objective by a factor of 5. Figure 2 shows learning curves for both of these methods in two adaptation settings as we vary the amount of labeled target-domain data. The system trained on Hack Forums is able to make good use of labeled data from Darkode: having access to 20 labeled posts leads to gains of roughly 7 F 1 . Interestingly, the system trained on Darkode is not able to make good use of labeled data from Hack Forums, and the domain-specific features actually cause a substantial drop in performance until we have included a substantial amount of data from Hack Forums. This likely indicates we are overfitting the small Hack Forums training set with the domain-specific features.",

Interestingly, OOV rates of a Darkode-trained system are generally lower, indicating that that forum has better all-around product to up to k + 1 total versions of each feature. coverage. A system trained on Darkode is therefore in some sense more domain-general than one trained on Hack Forums.",

In contrast, the Darkode-trained system obtains a 43% error reduction on Darkode relative to a Hack Forums-trained system. Darkode's better product coverage helps explain why Section 5.3 showed better performance of adapting Hack Forums to Darkode than vice versa: augmenting Hack Forums data with a few posts from Darkode can give critical knowledge about new products, but this is less true if the forums are reversed. Duplicating features and adding parameters to the learner also has less of a clear benefit when adapting from Darkode, when the types of knowledge that need to be added are less concrete.",
