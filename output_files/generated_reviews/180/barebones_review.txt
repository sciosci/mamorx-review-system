Here are my main feedback comments on this scientific paper:

1. The paper presents an interesting and valuable new dataset for studying product extraction from cybercrime forums. The task formulation as a hybrid of NER and slot-filling is well motivated.

2. The experimental analysis is thorough, examining multiple evaluation metrics and adaptation techniques. The learning curves and error analysis provide good insight into the domain adaptation challenges.

3. The paper could benefit from a clearer statement of contributions and novelty in the introduction. What specifically is new compared to prior work on IE from web forums?

4. The motivation for some of the adaptation techniques (e.g. Brown clusters) could be explained more clearly. Why were these specific methods chosen?

5. The results show only modest gains from the adaptation techniques explored. More discussion of why these methods were not more effective, and what approaches might work better, would strengthen the paper.

6. The analysis section provides good insights, but could go further in synthesizing the key takeaways and implications for future work on this problem.

7. Given the security-sensitive nature of the data, more details on the dataset creation process and ethical considerations would be valuable.

8. The paper is generally well-written, but there are a few places where the prose could be tightened up for clarity (e.g. the description of the annotation process).

9. A limitations section discussing shortcomings of the current approaches would help frame future work.

10. Expand on the potential applications and impact of this work for cybersecurity researchers and practitioners.

Overall, this is a solid paper presenting a valuable new dataset and task, with room to strengthen the framing and discussion of results. The thorough empirical analysis provides a good foundation for future work on this challenging domain adaptation problem.
