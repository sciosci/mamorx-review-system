The authors have developed a system that combines part-of-speech sentence templates with an n-gram language model to produce syntactically plausible and memorable sentences, addressing a practical problem in password security and number memorization.\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. Novelty: The paper introduces a unique method for encoding arbitrary sequences of digits into memorable sentences, which distinguishes it from existing tools and previous academic work. The combination of part-of-speech sentence templates with an n-gram language model is particularly innovative. This novelty is further emphasized by the focus on the major system for encoding numbers into memorable sentences, which represents a significant advancement in automated mnemonic generation not present in existing work on password selection advice or literary text matching for alphanumeric sequences.\n\n2. Comprehensive methodology: The authors develop and compare several encoding models, including baseline models (Random Encoder, Unigram Encoder), preliminary models (n-gram Encoder, Part-of-Speech Encoder, Chunk Encoder), and a final Sentence Encoder model. This thorough approach demonstrates a well-structured research process and provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of different encoding strategies.\n\n3. User study validation: The paper includes a user study to evaluate the memorability of the generated phrases, providing empirical evidence for the effectiveness of their approach. The study design considers short-term recall, long-term recall, long-term recognition, and subjective comparison, offering a comprehensive assessment of the system\\\\'s performance.\n\n4. Practical applications: The system has potential applications in improving password security, memorizing phone numbers, account numbers, and even long sequences like digits of \u03c0. This broad applicability enhances the paper\\\\'s impact and relevance.\n\n5. Clear positioning within the field: The authors provide a comprehensive overview of existing tools and academic work related to mnemonic encodings, effectively contextualizing their contribution within the broader research landscape.\n\nLimitations and Suggestions for Improvement:\n\n1. Limited dataset: The system relies on the intersection of the Brown corpus and CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, resulting in a relatively small vocabulary of about 34,000 words. This limitation could affect the diversity and quality of generated sentences. Future work should consider expanding the dataset by incorporating larger and more diverse corpora to increase the vocabulary and improve the quality and diversity of generated sentences.\n\n2. Potential bias in user study: The study participants were recruited from a computer science summer research program and through social media, which may not represent a diverse user base. This could limit the generalizability of the results. Conducting more extensive user studies with a more diverse participant pool would better evaluate the long-term memorability and usability of the system across different demographics.\n\n3. Short-term focus: While the user study includes a one-week follow-up, the primary focus seems to be on short-term memorability. More extensive long-term studies could provide stronger evidence for the system\\\\'s effectiveness in real-world applications.\n\n4. Limited exploration of sentence structures: The sentence encoder uses a fixed set of 100 most frequent sentence templates from the Brown corpus. This approach might limit the variety and naturalness of the generated sentences. Implementing more sophisticated natural language generation techniques could produce more varied and natural-sounding sentences, possibly incorporating recent advances in language models.\n\n5. Visual representation: The paper\\\\'s figures and tables could be improved to better illustrate the research process and findings. While the provided table of the Major System is clear and relevant, it represents only a small part of the research described. To enhance clarity and consistency between textual and visual elements, the authors should consider:\n   a. Including visual examples of generated sentences for specific number sequences.\n   b. Providing a diagram or flowchart of the proposed encoding models.\n   c. Including a table or graph showing results from the password memorability study.\n   d. Ensuring that all tables mentioned in captions (Tables 1, 2, and 3) are included and properly referenced in the paper.\n\n6. Lack of comparison with other mnemonic techniques: The study primarily compares the proposed method with numeric passwords and n-gram encodings. Comparing the system with other established mnemonic techniques would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its effectiveness.\n\n7. Ethical considerations: The paper would benefit from a discussion of potential ethical implications, such as the possibility of generating offensive or inappropriate sentences, and proposing safeguards against such issues.\n\n8. Scalability: Further exploration of the system\\\\'s performance and effectiveness for encoding much longer numerical sequences could expand its applications beyond password generation.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper presents a novel and promising approach to generating memorable sentences for encoding numerical sequences. The methodology is sound, and the user study provides encouraging results. The authors effectively demonstrate the potential of their system to improve password security and number memorization techniques. However, addressing the limitations mentioned above, particularly in terms of dataset expansion, diversity in user studies, and visual representation of the research process and findings, would significantly strengthen the paper and its potential impact in the field."]}

The introduction presents the key claims of the paper: Previous CNN approaches are bad when no phrase-level supervision is present. Phrase-level annotation is expensive. The contribution of this paper is instead a \\\"simple model\\\" using other linguistic resources.  The related work section provides a good review of sentiment literature. However, there is no mention of previous attempts at linguistic regularization (e.g., \\\\[YOG14\\\\]).  The explanation of the regularizers in section 4 is rather lengthy and repetitive. The listing on p. 3 could very well be merged with the respective subsection 4.1-4.4. Notation in this section is inconsistent and generally hard to follow. Most notably, p is sometimes used with a subscript and sometimes with a superscript.  The parameter \\beta is never explicitly mentioned in the text. It is not entirely clear to me what constitutes a \\\"position\\\" t in the terminology of the paper. t is a parameter to the LSTM output, so it seems to be the index of a sentence. Thus, t-1 is the preceding sentence, and p_t is the prediction for this sentence. However, the description of the regularizers talks about preceding words, not sentences, but still uses. My assumption here is that p_t is actually overloaded and may either mean the sentiment of a sentence or a word. However, this should be made clearer in the text.  One dangerous issue in this paper is that the authors tread a fine line between regularization and distant supervision in their work. The problem here is that there are many other ways to integrate lexical information from about polarity, negation information, etc. into a model (e.g., by putting the information into the features). The authors compare against a re-run or re-implementation of Teng et al.\\\\'s NSCL model. Here, it would be important to know whether the authors used the same lexicons as in their own work. If this is not the case, the comparison is not fair. Also, I do not understand why the authors cannot run NSCL on the MR dataset when they have access to an implementation of the model. Would this not just be a matter of swapping the datasets? The remaining baselines do not appear to be using lexical information, which makes them rather poor. I would very much like to see a vanilla LSTM run where lexical information is simply appended to the word vectors.  The authors end the paper with some helpful analysis of the models. These experiments show that the model indeed learns intensification and negation to some extent. In these experiments, it would be interesting to know how the model behaves with out-of-vocabulary words (with respect to the lexicons). Does the model learn beyond memorization, and does generalization happen for words that the model has not seen in training? Minor remark here: the figures and tables are too small to be read in print.  The paper is mostly well-written apart from the points noted above.  It could benefit from some proofreading as there are some grammatical errors and typos left. In particular, the beginning of the abstract is hard to read.  Overall, the paper pursues a reasonable line of research. The largest potential issue I see is a somewhat shaky comparison to related work. This could be fixed by including some stronger baselines in the final model. For me, it would be crucial to establish whether comparability is given in the experiments, and I hope that the authors can shed some light on this in their response.  \\\\[YOG14\\\\] http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P14-1074  --------------  Update after author response  Thank you for clarifying the concerns about the experimental setup.   NSCL: I do now believe that the comparison is with Teng et al. is fair.  LSTM: Good to know that you did this. However, this is a crucial part of the paper. As it stands, the baselines are weak. Marginal improvement is still too vague, better would be an open comparison including a significance test.  OOV: I understand how the model is defined, but what is the effect on OOV words? This would make for a much more interesting additional experiment than the current regularization experiments.\n"], "barebones": ["Here are my main comments on this scientific paper:\n\n1. The paper presents an interesting approach to incorporating linguistic knowledge about sentiment, negation, and intensity words into LSTM models for sentiment analysis. The linguistic regularizers seem like a promising way to inject this domain knowledge.\n\n2. The experimental results demonstrate improvements over standard LSTM/Bi-LSTM baselines on two benchmark datasets. The ablation studies help illustrate the contributions of the different regularizers.\n\n3. The analysis of how the negation and intensity regularizers affect predictions provides good insight into how the model is capturing these linguistic phenomena. The visualizations in Figures 1 and 2 are particularly illuminating.\n\n4. The approach seems relatively simple to implement on top of existing LSTM architectures, which is a strength. Not requiring expensive phrase-level annotations is also a nice feature.\n\n5.

Limited scope consideration: The authors acknowledge that they do not fully address the issue of modification scope for negation and intensity words, which could be a limitation in some cases.\n\n2. Dataset specificity: While the experiments are conducted on two popular datasets, it would be beneficial to see the model\\\\'s performance on a wider range of sentiment analysis tasks or domains to demonstrate its generalizability.\n\n3. Comparison to recent advances: While the paper compares against several strong baselines, it would be interesting to see comparisons with more recent state-of-the-art models in sentiment analysis, especially those leveraging large pre-trained language models.\n\nMethodology:\nThe authors propose four types of regularizers:\n1. Non-Sentiment Regularizer (NSR)\n2. Sentiment Regularizer (SR)\n3. Negation Regularizer (NR)\n4.

The regularizers are applied to both standard LSTM and bidirectional LSTM models. The approach is elegant in its simplicity while still capturing important linguistic phenomena.\n\nExperiments and Results:\nThe experiments are well-designed and comprehensive. The authors evaluate their models on both binary (MR dataset) and fine-grained (SST dataset) sentiment classification tasks. The results show that:\n\n1. Linguistically regularized LSTMs outperform their non-regularized counterparts significantly.\n2. The proposed models achieve comparable or better performance than tree-structured models without requiring parsing trees or phrase-level annotations.\n3.

The authors propose a method called Linguistically Regularized LSTM (LR-LSTM) that aims to address some of the limitations of previous neural network models for sentiment analysis.\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. Simplicity and Efficiency: Unlike previous models that depend on parsing tree structures and phrase-level annotations, LR-LSTM and LR-Bi-LSTM are simpler sequence models that only require sentence-level annotations. This makes them more efficient and easier to implement in real-world applications.\n\n2. Performance: The proposed models achieve competitive results compared to some existing methods, as shown in the performance tables for different datasets (MR, SST) and sub-datasets (negation and intensity).\n\n3. Linguistic Insights: The paper provides valuable insights into how different types of words (sentiment, negation, intensity) affect sentiment classification. The analysis of negation and intensity effects offers a nuanced understanding of these linguistic phenomena.\n\n4. Versatility: The approach works for both binary (MR dataset) and fine-grained (SST dataset) sentiment classification tasks, demonstrating its flexibility.\n\nLimitations and Areas for Improvement:\n\n1. Novelty: The paper\\\\'s claim of novelty is questionable. Several existing works already incorporate similar linguistic resources (sentiment lexicons, negation words, intensity words) into neural models for sentiment analysis. The approach presented here, while valuable, appears to be an incremental improvement rather than a groundbreaking innovation.\n\n2. Scope of Modification: The model does not explicitly consider the scope of negation and intensity words, which could potentially be improved.\n\n3. Limited Datasets: The evaluation is conducted on only two datasets (MR and SST). Including more diverse datasets would strengthen the generalizability of the findings.\n\n4. Comparison with Recent Models: The paper would benefit from comparison with more recent sentiment analysis models to better contextualize its contributions.\n\n5. Lexicon Dependency: The model relies on pre-existing sentiment lexicons, which might limit its applicability in low-resource scenarios.\n\n6. Fine-grained Analysis: A more fine-grained analysis of different types of sentiment, negation, and intensity words could offer deeper linguistic insights.\n\n7. Figure Clarity: The figures and tables presented could be improved for clarity. For instance, the table comparing model performances lacks a descriptive title and full model names, making it less accessible to readers unfamiliar with the specific abbreviations used.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n\n1. Clearly articulate the novelty: Given the existing work in this area, the authors should more precisely articulate what specific aspects of their approach are novel and how they advance the state of the art.\n\n2. Expand on the experimental setup: Include more details about hyperparameters, training time, and hardware used.\n\n3.

Compare with more recent baselines in sentiment analysis to better situate the work in the current research landscape.\n\n5. Explore the model\\\\'s performance on other languages, especially those with different negation and intensity patterns.\n\n6. Investigate the model\\\\'s interpretability further, possibly using techniques like attention mechanisms or LIME.\n\n7. Address the limitation of fixed sentiment lexicons by exploring methods to dynamically update or learn the sentiment lexicon during training.\n\n8. Improve the presentation of figures and tables: Add more descriptive titles, include full model names rather than abbreviations, and provide brief explanations of metrics used directly in the tables.\n\n9. In the abstract and introduction, provide a clearer roadmap of the specific methodologies, datasets, and comparisons made in the study to better set reader expectations.\n\nPotential Impact:\n\nWhile this paper makes a contribution to the field of sentiment analysis by demonstrating a method for incorporating linguistic knowledge into neural models, its impact may be limited by the lack of significant novelty. The simplicity and efficiency of the model make it applicable to real-world scenarios, and the linguistic regularizers could inspire similar approaches in other areas of NLP. However, to maximize impact, the authors should focus on clearly differentiating their approach from existing work and demonstrating substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper represents a valuable contribution to the field of sentiment analysis, aiming to bridge the gap between linguistic knowledge and neural models. While there are significant areas for potential improvement and extension, the work opens up directions for future research in incorporating linguistic insights into deep learning models for natural language processing tasks. The authors are encouraged to address the limitations noted, particularly regarding novelty and comparative analysis, to strengthen the paper\\\\'s contribution to the field."]}

The authors aim to overcome reporting bias in natural language and demonstrate that it\\\\'s possible to infer physical knowledge from text by leveraging consistency in how people describe interactions with the world. The research focuses on inferring relative physical knowledge about object pairs and physical implications of actions along five dimensions: size, weight, strength, rigidness, and speed.\n\nContributions and Approach:\n1. Introduction of a new task: commonsense knowledge extraction from language, focusing on physical implications of actions and relative physical relations among objects.\n2. Development of a model that can infer relations over grounded object pairs together with first-order relations implied by physical verbs.\n3. Creation of a new dataset called VERBPHYSICS, compiling crowd-sourced knowledge of actions and objects.\n\nThe authors use a factor graph model for joint inference over object pairs and verb frames, utilizing crowd-sourced data to create their dataset of physical knowledge.\n\nMethodology and Experiments:\nThe researchers conducted experiments on frame prediction and object pair prediction tasks. They compared their model (OUR MODEL) with baselines, including a random baseline, majority baseline, and an embedding-based maximum entropy classifier (EMB-MAXENT). Two versions of their model were tested: OUR MODEL (A) using 5% of object pairs as seed data, and OUR MODEL (B) using 20% of object pairs as seed data.\n\nResults and Performance:\nThe results show that the authors\\\\' model generally outperformed the baselines, especially when using a larger seed dataset (20% of object pairs). Ablation studies on the size attribute for the frame prediction task were performed to analyze the impact of different components of their model. The final model (OUR MODEL (B)) employs only unary embeddings and selectional preference factors, suggesting these are the most crucial components for performance.\n\nClarity and Presentation:\nThe paper is generally well-structured, with clear explanations of the problem, approach, and results. The authors provide helpful visualizations, such as figures showing example physical implications represented as frame relations and illustrating the high-level view of the factor graph model. These visual aids enhance the clarity of the complex concepts presented in the paper.\n\nImpact and Significance:\nThis work makes several significant contributions to the field:\n1. It addresses the challenge of extracting commonsense knowledge from text, which is crucial for advancing natural language understanding and AI systems.\n2. The focus on physical knowledge, particularly on dimensions like weight, strength, rigidness, and speed, provides unique value as these attributes are not easily recognizable from current computer vision techniques.\n3. The frame-centric approach to circumvent reporting bias is innovative and could be applied to other areas of knowledge extraction.\n4. The VERBPHYSICS dataset could be a valuable resource for future research in this area.\n\nLimitations and Critical Analysis:\n1. Metaphorical Language: The authors acknowledge challenges in dealing with metaphorical language. While their frame patterns are intended to capture action verbs, the templates also match senses of verbs that can be used with abstract or metaphorical arguments. This limitation could affect the accuracy of the extracted knowledge in certain contexts.\n\n2. Dataset Quality: While the creation of the VERBPHYSICS dataset is a significant contribution, there\\\\'s limited discussion on potential biases or limitations in the crowdsourcing process. A more detailed analysis of inter-annotator agreement and potential biases in the dataset would strengthen the paper.\n\n3. Model Sensitivity: The paper doesn\\\\'t thoroughly explore the model\\\\'s sensitivity to the choice of seed knowledge. A more in-depth analysis of how different seed knowledge affects the model\\\\'s performance would provide valuable insights into the robustness of the approach.\n\n4. Scalability: The authors mention that their approach using focal stacks in the training process may be resource-intensive.

The work addresses the challenge of learning commonsense knowledge from text, which is complicated by reporting bias - the tendency for people to omit stating obvious information.\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. Novelty: The paper introduces a new task of commonsense knowledge extraction from language, specifically focusing on physical implications of actions and relative physical relations among objects. This approach is unique in its attempt to learn a specific set of physical attributes from text at scale, rather than relying on existing databases or small-scale multimodal studies. The novelty assessment confirms that this work represents a distinct and innovative contribution to the field of commonsense reasoning and knowledge extraction.\n\n2.

Limited Scope: While the focus on five physical dimensions (size, weight, strength, rigidness, and speed) is well-justified, it may be worth discussing how the approach could be extended to other types of commonsense knowledge. The abstract mentions six dimensions, but only five are consistently discussed throughout the paper, which should be clarified.\n\n2. Abstraction and Metaphor: The paper briefly mentions handling metaphorical language (e.g., \\\"contained\\\" in abstract contexts), but this could be explored further. It would be interesting to see how well the model performs on more abstract or metaphorical uses of verbs.\n\n3. Error Analysis: While the paper provides ablation studies, a more detailed error analysis could offer insights into where the model struggles and potential avenues for improvement.\n\n4. Comparison to Multimodal Approaches: Although the authors mention that their work complements attempts to acquire commonsense knowledge from web images, a more direct comparison or discussion of how these approaches could be combined would be valuable.\n\n5.

Consistency between Abstract and Visuals: Ensure that all key concepts mentioned in the abstract are clearly represented in the figures and tables. For example, the six dimensions of physical knowledge and the joint inference process could be more explicitly visualized.\n\n7. Data Collection Methodology: The abstract could benefit from briefly mentioning the crowd-sourcing aspect of data collection, as this is an important part of the methodology not currently highlighted in the abstract.\n\nSuggestions for Further Improvement:\n\n1. Expand the discussion on handling metaphorical and abstract language use. This could include additional examples and analysis of how the model performs in these cases.\n\n2. Provide a more detailed error analysis, perhaps including examples of cases where the model fails and discussing potential reasons and solutions.\n\n3. Explore the potential for combining this text-based approach with multimodal methods that use visual information. This could lead to interesting future work directions.\n\n4.

Word-level Weighting: The current version does not use word-level weights, which might limit performance in some cases. Exploring word-level weighting schemes could potentially enhance results.\n\n4. Computational Efficiency: The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the computational requirements of TextFlow compared to existing approaches. This information would be valuable for assessing its practical applicability.\n\n5. Limited Scope of Comparison: While the paper compares TextFlow with traditional similarity measures, it would benefit from comparisons with more recent deep learning-based approaches to text similarity.\n\nMethodology and Experimental Setup:\nThe authors provide a clear explanation of the TextFlow concept, its mathematical formulation, and its implementation. The experimental setup is comprehensive, covering multiple datasets and tasks. The introduction of a new evaluation measure (CORE) for assessing system consistency across datasets is a valuable contribution.\n\nThe paper uses standard evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1, precision, recall) and provides detailed results for both XFc and XFt versions. The additional experiments on bi-grams and tri-grams, as well as the ranking correlation experiments, strengthen the evaluation.\n\nVisual Presentation and Clarity:\nThe paper includes several figures and tables that illustrate key concepts and results. However, there are areas where the visual presentation could be improved:\n\n1. Figure 1, showing a dot matrix for DNA sequences, could benefit from a clearer explanation of its relevance to the TextFlow method.\n\n2. Figure 2, illustrating the TextFlow intuition, lacks proper labeling and a clear explanation of what the curves represent. Improving this figure would enhance readers\\\\' understanding of the core concept.\n\n3. The neural network architectures (Figures 5 and 6) are mentioned but not fully explained in the context of TextFlow\\\\'s implementation.\n\n4. The paper would benefit from additional visualizations that directly showcase the performance of TextFlow across the eight datasets mentioned in the abstract.\n\n5. Consider adding a figure that explicitly shows how TextFlow processes actual text pairs, perhaps alongside examples of other methods for comparison.\n\nImpact and Future Work:\nTextFlow represents a significant step forward in text similarity measures, demonstrating the importance of considering word order and positions. Its consistent performance across various tasks suggests potential for wide adoption in the NLP community.\n\nFuture work could focus on:\n1. Addressing the limitations in recall performance\n2. Incorporating word-level weighting schemes\n3. Expanding the evaluation to a wider range of NLP tasks and datasets\n4. Optimizing for F1 score in addition to accuracy\n5. Exploring the scalability of the approach for very large datasets or real-time applications\n6. Improving the visual presentation of key concepts and results\n\nIn conclusion, \\\"TextFlow: A Text Similarity Measure based on Continuous Sequences\\\" presents a novel and promising approach to text similarity measurement with potential impact across various NLP tasks. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in the visual presentation and some performance aspects, the overall results and innovative method make this paper a valuable contribution to the field. The authors\\\\' provision of code and datasets further enhances the paper\\\\'s impact by promoting reproducibility and further research in this direction. Addressing the identified limitations and improving the clarity of visual elements would significantly strengthen the paper\\\\'s overall impact and accessibility to the broader NLP community."]}

Dataset Creation: The authors have created a valuable resource for the NLP and cybersecurity communities by annotating a dataset of 93,924 posts from four different cybercrime forums. This dataset, with 1,938 annotated posts, provides a solid foundation for future research in this area. The detailed description of the annotation process, including inter-annotator agreement scores and examples of annotated data, enhances the dataset\\\\'s credibility and usability.\n\n2.

Further investigation into more effective adaptation techniques could strengthen the paper, potentially exploring advanced methods like adversarial training or meta-learning approaches.\n\n2. Annotation Complexity: The token-level annotation process described seems complex and time-consuming. The authors could consider exploring ways to simplify this process or investigate whether post-level annotation could be sufficient for some applications. Additionally, they could discuss the scalability of their annotation approach to a larger number of forums or different languages.\n\n3. Error Analysis: While the paper provides some analysis of system performance on seen vs. unseen products, a more detailed error analysis could offer insights into the specific challenges of cross-forum adaptation and guide future research directions.

Results are presented for Chinese->Spanish translation, but the approach seems to be largely language-independent.  The setting is fairly typical for two-step MT. The first step translates into a morphologically underspecified version of the target language. The second step then uses machine learning to fill in the missing morphological categories and produces the final system output by inflecting the underspecified forms (using a morphological generator). The main novelty of this work is the choice of deep NNs as classifiers in the second step. The authors also propose a rescoring step which uses a LM to select the best variant.  Overall, this is solid work with good empirical results: the classifier models reach a high accuracy (clearly outperforming baselines such as SVMs) and the improvement is apparent even in the final translation quality.  My main problem with the paper is the lack of a comparison with some straightforward deep-learning baselines. Specifically, you have a structured prediction problem and you address it with independent local decisions followed by a rescoring step. (Unless I misunderstood the approach.) But this is a sequence labeling task which RNNs are well suited for. How would e.g. a bidirectional LSTM network do when trained and used in the standard sequence labeling setting? After reading the author response, I still think that baselines (including the standard LSTM) are run in the same framework, i.e. independently for each local label. If that\\\\'s not the case, it should have been clarified better in the response. This is a problem because you\\\\'re not using the RNNs in the standard way and yet you don\\\\'t justify why your way is better or compare the two approaches.  The final re-scoring step is not entirely clear to me. Do you rescore n-best sentences? What features do you use? Or are you searching a weighted graph for the single optimal path? This needs to be explained more clearly in the paper. (My current impression is that you produce a graph, then look for K best paths in it, generate the inflected sentences from these K paths and *then* use a LM -- and nothing else -- to select the best variant. But I\\\\'m not sure from reading the paper.) This was not addressed in the response.  You report that larger word embeddings lead to a longer training time. Do they also influence the final results?  Can you attempt to explain why adding information from the source sentence hurts? This seems a bit counter-intuitive -- does e.g. the number information not get entirely lost sometimes because of this? I would appreciate a more thorough discussion on this in the final version, perhaps with a couple of convincing examples.

The authors used RNN based generative models (discussed as RNN and Copy RNN) for keyphrase prediction and copy mechanism in RNN to predict the already occurred phrases.   Strengths:  1. The formation and extraction of key phrases, which are absent in the current document is an interesting idea of significant research interests.   2. The paper is easily understandable.  3. The use of RNN and Copy RNN in the current context is a new idea. As, deep recurrent neural networks are already used in keyphrase extraction (shows very good performance also), so, it will be interesting to have a proper motivation to justify the use of  RNN and Copy RNN over deep recurrent neural networks.   Weaknesses:  1. Some discussions are required on the convergence of the proposed joint learning process (for RNN and CopyRNN), so that readers can understand, how the stable points in probabilistic metric space are obtained? Otherwise, it may be tough to repeat the results.  2. The evaluation process shows that the current system (which extracts 1. Present and 2. Absent both kinds of keyphrases) is evaluated against baselines (which contains only \\\"present\\\" type of keyphrases). Here there is no direct comparison of the performance of the current system w.r.t. other state-of-the-arts/benchmark systems on only \\\"present\\\" type of key phrases. It is important to note that local phrases (keyphrases) are also important for the document. The experiment does not discuss it explicitly. It will be interesting to see the impact of the RNN and Copy RNN based model on automatic extraction of local or \\\"present\\\" type of key phrases.  3. The impact of document size in keyphrase extraction is also an important point.

It is reported that current system uses 527,830 documents for training, while 40,000 publications are held out for training baselines. Why are all publications not used in training the baselines? Additionally,        The topical details of the dataset (527,830 scientific documents) used in training RNN and Copy RNN are also missing. This may affect the chances of repeating results.  5. As the current system captures the semantics through RNN based models. So, it would be better to compare this system, which also captures semantics. Even, Ref-\\\\[2\\\\] can be a strong baseline to compare the performance of the current system.  Suggestions to improve:  1. As, per the example, given in the Figure-1, it seems that all the \\\"absent\\\" type of key phrases are actually \\\"Topical phrases\\\". For example: \\\"video search\\\", \\\"video retrieval\\\", \\\"video indexing\\\" and \\\"relevance ranking\\\", etc. These all define the domain/sub-domain/topics of the document. So, In this case, it will be interesting to see the results (or will be helpful in evaluating \\\"absent type\\\" keyphrases): if we identify all the topical phrases of the entire corpus by using tf-idf and relate the document to the high-ranked extracted topical phrases (by using Normalized Google Distance, PMI, etc.). As similar efforts are already applied in several query expansion techniques (with the aim to relate the document with the query, if matching terms are absent in document).  Reference: 1.

The authors propose this method to address limitations in existing keyphrase extraction techniques, particularly the inability to generate absent keyphrases and capture semantic meaning.\n\nNovelty and Contribution:\nThe paper introduces several innovative aspects to the field of keyphrase generation:\n1. It is the first to apply an RNN-based generative model to keyphrase prediction, enabling the generation of keyphrases that may not appear in the source text.\n2. The incorporation of a copy mechanism allows the model to handle rarely-occurred phrases and out-of-vocabulary words, a significant improvement over previous methods.\n3. It addresses the previously untackled problem of absent keyphrase prediction for scientific publications.\n4. The model captures both semantic and syntactic features of the text, leading to improved keyphrase generation.\n5. The approach significantly outperforms existing supervised and unsupervised extraction methods, as demonstrated by comprehensive comparisons against six important baselines on a broad range of datasets.\n\nThe novelty assessment confirms that this paper represents a significant advancement in the field, particularly in its ability to generate absent keyphrases based on semantic meaning, which addresses a key limitation of traditional extractive methods.\n\nStrengths:\n1. Performance: The proposed CopyRNN model significantly outperforms existing methods, showing an average improvement of over 20% compared to the best baselines for present keyphrase extraction.\n2. Absent keyphrase generation: The model demonstrates the ability to generate keyphrases that do not appear in the source text, recalling up to 20% of absent keyphrases in the top 50 predictions.\n3. Scalability: The authors use a large-scale dataset of 567,830 articles for training, which is 200 times larger than previous datasets, potentially improving the model\\\\'s robustness and generalizability.\n4. Transferability: The model shows some ability to transfer to other domains, as demonstrated by its performance on news articles (DUC-2001 dataset) after being trained on scientific publications.\n\nLimitations and areas for improvement:\n1. Limited analysis of generated absent keyphrases: While the ability to generate absent keyphrases is a significant contribution, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the quality and relevance of these generated phrases.\n2.

Including human evaluation of the generated keyphrases would strengthen the paper\\\\'s claims about the model\\\\'s effectiveness.\n3. Correlation among keyphrases: The current model does not fully consider the relationships between target keyphrases. Exploring multiple-output optimization could potentially improve the coherence of the generated keyphrase set.\n4. Domain adaptation: Although the model shows some transferability to news articles, its performance drops significantly compared to in-domain results. Further exploration of domain adaptation techniques could enhance the model\\\\'s versatility.\n5. Comparison with more recent baselines: While the paper compares the proposed model with several established baselines, including more recent deep learning-based methods could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.\n\nFigure Analysis:\nThe paper includes several figures and tables that effectively illustrate the proposed model and its performance. However, there are some inconsistencies and areas for improvement in the presentation of these visuals:\n\n1. The abstract mentions six datasets, but the captions only refer to five benchmark datasets and four public datasets. This discrepancy should be addressed for clarity.\n2. The abstract doesn\\\\'t explicitly mention RNN or CopyRNN models, which are prominently featured in the tables. Including these specific model names in the abstract would better align with the presented results.\n3. The tables provided are incomplete, making it difficult to fully assess their relevance to the abstract. Including all referenced visuals would greatly improve clarity.\n4. The captions for the tables could be more organized and coherent. They appear to be a mix of table titles and fragmented sentences, which reduces clarity.\n5. The metrics shown (R@5, R@10, F1) are not explained in the provided information, which could be confusing for readers unfamiliar with the field. Adding a legend or explanation for these metrics would enhance understanding.\n\nConstructive feedback:\n1.

Implement human evaluation to assess the quality and relevance of both present and absent generated keyphrases.\n3. Explore techniques to capture relationships between keyphrases, potentially improving the coherence of the generated set.\n4. Investigate domain adaptation methods to enhance the model\\\\'s performance on different types of text.\n5. Compare the model with more recent deep learning-based keyphrase generation methods to strengthen the evaluation.\n6. Analyze the impact of different components (e.g., attention mechanism, copy mechanism) on the model\\\\'s performance through ablation studies.\n7. Discuss potential applications of the model in information retrieval and document summarization tasks.\n8. Improve the presentation of figures and tables by ensuring consistency with the abstract, providing clear and comprehensive captions, and including all referenced visuals.\n9. Add explanations for the metrics used in the tables to enhance readability for a broader audience.\n10. Revise the abstract to explicitly mention the specific models (RNN, CopyRNN) and datasets used in the study to create a stronger connection between the text and the visual data.\n\nIn conclusion, \\\"Deep Keyphrase Generation\\\" presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of automatic keyphrase generation.

Summary and Novelty:\n\nThis paper introduces a novel approach to word embeddings that addresses a fundamental limitation of traditional type-level embeddings: their inability to handle lexical ambiguity. The authors present a method for creating context-sensitive token embeddings grounded in WordNet, a lexical database of English. This approach represents a significant contribution to the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) as it bridges the gap between distributional semantics and structured knowledge.\n\nThe novelty of this work lies in its specific application of ontology-grounded token embeddings to prepositional phrase (PP) attachment prediction. While previous research has explored context-sensitive embeddings and word sense disambiguation, this paper\\\\'s unique contribution is the joint learning of concept embeddings and model parameters for a specific syntactic task (PP attachment). The reported 34.4% relative error reduction demonstrates a substantial improvement over existing methods.\n\nKey Contributions:\na) A method to represent word tokens as context-sensitive distributions over WordNet concepts (synsets and their hypernyms).\nb) A model (OntoLSTM-PP) that jointly learns concept embeddings and task-specific parameters for PP attachment prediction.\nc) Empirical demonstration of the effectiveness of these embeddings in improving PP attachment accuracy.\n\n2. Methodology:\n\nThe OntoLSTM-PP model uses a bidirectional LSTM to encode sequences of words, with each word represented as a weighted sum of concept embeddings. The process involves:\n\na) Grounding words using WordNet synsets and their hypernyms.\nb) Computing context-sensitive token embeddings using a combination of a sense prior (based on WordNet sense ordering) and a context-sensitive attention mechanism.\nc) Applying the model to the task of PP attachment prediction.\n\n3. Results and Performance:\n\nThe paper demonstrates substantial improvements in PP attachment accuracy:\n- A 5.4% absolute improvement (89.7% vs. 84.3%) over their LSTM-PP baseline.\n- This translates to a 34.4% relative reduction in errors, which is significant for this challenging NLP task.\n- When integrated into a dependency parser, the model showed improvements in both overall unlabeled attachment score (UAS) and PP attachment accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.\n\n4. Strengths:\n\na) Innovation: The paper presents a novel way to create context-sensitive word embeddings grounded in a lexical ontology, addressing limitations of traditional type-level embeddings.\nb) Context-sensitivity: The model effectively distinguishes between different meanings of the same word in different contexts.\nc) Implicit regularization: Sharing of concept embeddings across words provides a regularization effect, particularly beneficial for rare words.\nd) Handling out-of-vocabulary words: The model can represent words not seen in training data using WordNet concepts.\ne) Performance: Achieves state-of-the-art results on the PP attachment task.\nf) Flexibility: Can handle words not present in WordNet by augmenting ontological information with distributional information.\ng) Thorough analysis: Provides detailed qualitative and quantitative analyses, including ablation studies and performance comparisons at different training data sizes.\n\n5. Limitations and Areas for Improvement:\n\na) Task specificity: While the paper demonstrates effectiveness on PP attachment, its performance on a wider range of NLP tasks is not explored.\nb) Computational complexity: The paper lacks a thorough discussion of the computational overhead compared to simpler embedding approaches.\nc) WordNet limitations: While acknowledged, the paper could further explore how to mitigate these limitations or integrate other knowledge sources.\nd) Hyperparameter sensitivity: A more detailed discussion on the sensitivity of the model to various hyperparameters (e.g., maximum number of senses and hypernyms used) would be beneficial.\ne) Visual representation: The figures and tables provided in the paper could be improved for clarity and consistency with the abstract. Some captions seem incomplete or disconnected from the actual visuals, which hinders understanding of the presented data.\nf) Clarity of methodology: While the abstract outlines the approach, the paper could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the steps involved in computing context-sensitive embeddings, as hinted at in the fragmented captions.\n\n6. Constructive Feedback:\n\na) Extend evaluation to other NLP tasks: Demonstrating effectiveness on tasks like named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, or question answering would strengthen the paper\\\\'s impact.\nb) Provide runtime performance details: Include information on training and inference times compared to baseline models.\nc) Explore combining WordNet with other resources: Investigate extending the model to incorporate information from other structured knowledge sources like Freebase or Wikidata.\nd) Conduct more extensive error analysis: Identify patterns in cases where OntoLSTM-PP fails to provide insights for further improvements.\ne) Discuss potential biases: Address any biases that might be introduced by relying on WordNet and how these could affect performance across different domains or languages.\nf) Improve visual elements: Ensure that all figures and tables are properly labeled, have complete captions, and directly support the claims made in the abstract and main text. Consider adding visualizations that better illustrate the context-sensitive embedding process and its application to PP attachment.\ng) Enhance abstract: Include a brief mention of WordNet in the abstract to better connect it with the methodology, and consider adding a sentence about specific experiments or comparisons conducted to provide context for the tables and figures.\nh) Clarify terminology: Ensure that all acronyms and technical terms (e.g., synsets, RBG, LSTM-PP) are properly introduced and explained for readers who may not be familiar with them.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper presents a promising approach to context-sensitive word embeddings with significant improvements in PP attachment prediction. By addressing the suggested improvements, particularly in expanding the evaluation to other NLP tasks and enhancing the clarity of visual representations, the authors could further strengthen the impact and accessibility of their work."]}

Based on the transition-based neural word segmentation, this paper aims to pre-train incoming characters with external resources (punctuation, soft segmentation, POS, and heterogeneous training data) through multi-task learning. That is, this paper casts each external source as an auxiliary classification task. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performances in six out of seven datasets.   This paper is well-written and easy to understand. A number of experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. However, there exist an issue in this paper. The proposed method is a semi-supervised learning that uses external resources to pre-train the characters. Furthermore, this paper uses another heterogeneous training datasets even if it uses the datasets only for pre-training. Nevertheless, the baselines in the experiments are based on supervised learning. In general, the performance of semi-supervised learning is better than that of supervised learning because semi-supervised learning makes use of plentiful auxiliary information. In the experiments, this paper should have compared the proposed method with semi-supervised approaches.

Some baselines in the experiments used label information, where the labels are predicted automatically by their base models as the authors pointed out. When insisting superiority of a method, all circumstances should be same.

The authors present a general model that respects the unordered nature of sets and avoids the discontinuity issues that plague current approaches. This work is particularly significant as it tackles a fundamental problem in structured prediction tasks where the output is a set.\n\nNovelty and Core Idea:\nThe key innovation of this paper lies in its approach to set prediction. Unlike traditional methods that ignore the set structure and suffer from the \"responsibility problem,\" this model properly respects the set structure by using gradient descent to find a set that encodes to a given feature vector. This approach is based on the crucial observation that the gradient of a set encoder with respect to the input set is permutation-equivariant.\n\nThe core idea can be intuitively explained as follows: instead of directly predicting a set, the model learns to iteratively refine an initial guess by minimizing the difference between the encoding of the predicted set and the target encoding. This process naturally handles the permutation-invariance of sets and avoids the discontinuities that arise when forcing an ordered output to represent an unordered set.\n\nMethodology:\nThe authors present a nested optimization approach:\n1. An inner loop that changes a set to encode more similarly to the input feature vector.\n2. An outer loop that changes the weights of the encoder to minimize a loss over a dataset.\n\nThis method is applied to three increasingly complex scenarios:\n1. Auto-encoding fixed-size sets\n2. Auto-encoding variable-size sets\n3. Predicting sets from a feature vector (general set prediction)\n\nThe model uses a representation loss and a set loss, combining them to ensure that the predicted set not only encodes similarly to the target but also resembles the target set itself.\n\nExperimental Results:\nThe paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments on various tasks:\n1. MNIST set auto-encoding\n2. Object detection (bounding box prediction) on the CLEVR dataset\n3. Full scene state prediction on CLEVR\n\nIn all cases, the proposed model outperforms baseline methods (MLP and RNN decoders) in terms of accuracy and precision. Notably, the model shows significant improvements in strict evaluation metrics (e.g., AP95 and AP98 for bounding box prediction), indicating its ability to make precise predictions.\n\nTechnical Details:\nThe paper introduces important technical concepts such as the Hungarian loss and Chamfer loss for comparing sets. The Hungarian loss is a method for finding the optimal assignment between predicted and target set elements, while the Chamfer loss measures the average distance between each element in one set to its nearest neighbor in the other set. The paper also explains the use of mask features for handling variable-size sets and the incorporation of a representation loss term in the supervised learning setting.\n\nStrengths:\n1. Novel approach that fundamentally addresses the set prediction problem\n2. Generalizability to various set prediction tasks\n3. Ability to handle both fixed and variable-size sets\n4. Improved performance on strict evaluation metrics\n5. Flexibility in adjusting the number of optimization steps at inference time\n\nLimitations and Future Work:\n1. Higher computational cost due to multiple passes through the set encoder\n2. Potential for overshooting the optimal solution when using more iterations than during training\n3. Reliance on the quality of the set encoder for accurate predictions\n\nFuture work could focus on:\n1. Developing more efficient set encoders to reduce computational costs\n2. Exploring better initialization methods for the predicted set to speed up convergence\n3. Investigating adaptive stopping criteria for the inner optimization loop\n4. Extending the approach to related domains such as graph prediction\n\nPractical Implications:\nThis work has significant implications for various applications, including:\n1. Object detection in computer vision\n2. Point cloud processing in 3D perception\n3. Molecular graph generation in chemistry\n4. Scene graph prediction from images\n\nThe ability to predict sets accurately and efficiently could lead to improvements in these and other fields where set-structured data is prevalent.\n\nReproducibility:\nThe paper provides sufficient details to reproduce the experiments.

The authors propose a general model called Deep Set Prediction Networks (DSPN) that aims to avoid the discontinuity issues faced by current approaches that ignore the set structure. The model can predict sets from a single feature vector input and is demonstrated to work on tasks such as auto-encoding point sets, predicting bounding boxes of objects in images, and predicting object attributes.\n\nKey Contributions:\n1. A new model for vector-to-set prediction that respects set structure and aims to address the \\\"responsibility problem\\\" faced by existing methods.\n2. An approach using backpropagation through a set encoder as a decoder, with nested optimization loops for set prediction.\n3. Demonstration of the model\\\\'s performance on various set prediction tasks, including MNIST auto-encoding, object detection, and scene state prediction.\n\nMethodology:\nThe core idea of DSPN is to use gradient descent to find a set that encodes to a given feature vector, leveraging the permutation-equivariant property of set encoder gradients. This approach involves:\n- An inner optimization loop that updates a set to better match the input feature vector.\n- An outer optimization loop that trains the encoder weights to minimize loss over a dataset.\n- A representation loss (L_repr) that compares predicted and target sets in latent space.\n- Modifications to handle variable-size sets and predict sets from feature vectors not derived from sets.\n\nExperiments and Results:\nThe authors evaluate DSPN on three main tasks:\n1. MNIST set auto-encoding: DSPN outperforms MLP and RNN baselines with lower reconstruction loss (0.09 vs 0.21 and 0.49).\n2. Bounding box prediction on CLEVR: DSPN achieves higher Average Precision scores, especially for strict IoU thresholds (e.g., AP_95: 85.7% vs 57.9% for MLP baseline).\n3. Scene state prediction on CLEVR: DSPN significantly outperforms baselines in predicting object attributes and 3D positions (e.g., AP_\u221e: 72.8% vs 3.6% for MLP baseline).\n\nThe results demonstrate DSPN\\\\'s improved performance in predicting sets across various tasks and set sizes.\n\nNovelty and Significance:\nWhile the paper presents an interesting approach to set prediction that aims to address issues in existing methods, the novelty of the work is somewhat limited. The key aspects include:\n1. The use of backpropagation through a set encoder as a decoding mechanism.\n2. A nested optimization approach for end-to-end training of set prediction models.\n3. A framework applicable to various set prediction tasks without task-specific assumptions.\n\nHowever, the core ideas build upon existing concepts in deep learning and set prediction, rather than introducing fundamentally new paradigms. The significance lies in potentially enabling more accurate set prediction, which has applications in object detection, point cloud processing, and graph generation tasks.\n\nStrengths:\n1. Addresses a known problem in set prediction (the responsibility problem) with a mathematically grounded approach.\n2. Demonstrates improvement over baselines across multiple tasks and set sizes.\n3. Provides a general framework that can be applied to various set prediction problems.\n4. Offers insights into the model\\\\'s behavior, such as the ability to trade off between prediction quality and inference time.\n\nLimitations and Areas for Improvement:\n1. Increased computational cost due to multiple passes through the set encoder (about 75% longer training time).\n2. Potential for overshooting optimal solutions when using more iterations than trained with.\n3. Limited comparison with state-of-the-art object detection methods in the bounding box prediction task.\n4. Lack of extensive ablation studies to provide insights into the contribution of different components of the model.\n5.

The paper would benefit from a figure or explanation that directly addresses the discontinuity issue mentioned in the abstract.\n7. More clarity is needed on whether a single feature vector input is consistently used across all experiments, as mentioned in the abstract.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Conduct more extensive ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components and hyperparameters.\n2. Explore adaptive methods to determine the optimal number of inner optimization steps for each input.\n3. Investigate techniques to improve computational efficiency, such as more efficient set encoders or better initialization strategies.\n4. Extend the evaluation to a wider range of real-world datasets to further demonstrate the model\\\\'s generalizability.\n5. Include a brief mention of the datasets and baseline comparisons in the abstract.\n6. Add a sentence in the abstract about the iterative nature of the algorithm, which is evident from the progression visualizations in Figures 1 and 2.\n7. Consider adding a figure or explanation that directly addresses the discontinuity issue mentioned in the abstract.\n8. Briefly mention the key evaluation metrics (Chamfer reconstruction loss, Average Precision) in the abstract to give readers a better idea of how the model\\\\'s performance is assessed.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Deep Set Prediction Networks paper presents an interesting approach to set prediction with some improvements over baselines, there are areas where the work could be strengthened. Addressing the limitations and incorporating the suggested improvements would enhance the paper\\\\'s contribution to the field of set prediction and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method."]}

Interesting perspective at the end of Section 2 with the bag-of-word and bag-of-position perspective. It is clear how this work differs from previous work. Related work is adequately cited, but some sections of the paper were missing credibility by the lack of citations, in particular, line 72-74 and 87-89. In general, any claim about key properties such as independence or other mathematical concepts should be supported by appropriate references.  QUALITY : (average) Overall this submission is of good quality, but non-negligible improvements need to be considered. Claims are not all supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results. For instance, I was not convinced about the following claims: - line 72-74: \\\"The calculations performed on any given element of a sequence are entirely independent of the order of the rest of that sequence in that layer; ...\\\". - line 88: \\\"any relationship between two positions can be modeled by an affine transform ...\\\". - line 107,108: \\\"... and k, the maximum tree depth for which our constraint is preserved.\\\" - line 117-119: It is not clear at all why this is the case All such claims need to be better supported by some evidence (either theoretical or experimental or at least by citing previous work). While introducing a novel mechanism, this submission could be more convincing with more experiments, in particular with more complex tree structures. This was properly acknowledged by the authors. Some sections of the paper need better motivation; in particular the paragraph between lines 121 and 126. the \\\"lack of richness\\\" is not enough motivation to add complexity to the already complex encoding. Did the parameter-free positional encoding scheme didn\\\\'t work at all? In any case, experimental evidence is required to motivate this choice.

The captions could be improved by providing more explicit links between the visualizations and the claims made in the abstract and main text.\n\nImpact:\n\nDespite the concerns about novelty, the paper presents advancements with potential for impact:\n1. The performance improvements demonstrated across various tasks are substantial, particularly in program translation and semantic parsing on larger datasets.\n2. The approach has potential applications in programming language translation, semantic parsing, abstract syntax tree processing, and potentially in natural language processing tasks involving parse trees.\n3. The work extends transformer models to non-sequential data, opening possibilities for applying transformer architectures to a wider range of data structures and problem domains.\n4. The custom positional encoding scheme could inspire similar approaches for other types of structured data.\n5. The model\\\\'s ability to bridge sequential and hierarchical representations could lead to new approaches in combining different types of data or model architectures.\n\nIn conclusion, while this paper presents an interesting approach to handling tree-structured data with transformers, its novelty is questionable given existing literature. The authors should more clearly articulate the specific advancements of their method compared to previous work. The paper would benefit from addressing the identified limitations, particularly in terms of experimental depth and clarity of presentation. Despite these concerns, the demonstrated performance improvements and potential applications make this work potentially impactful. Future work should focus on more comprehensive comparisons with existing methods, exploration of non-binary trees, and analysis of scalability to larger and more complex datasets."]}

The authors demonstrate that this simple toolkit can effectively tackle various challenging image manipulation tasks, including generation, inpainting, image-to-image translation, super-resolution, and interactive manipulation.\n\nNovelty and Contribution:\nThe key novelty of this work lies in its simplicity and versatility. Unlike many state-of-the-art approaches that rely on complex, task-specific techniques (often based on Generative Adversarial Networks), this paper shows that a single robust classifier can perform multiple image synthesis tasks. The authors leverage adversarial robustness as a fundamental property to enable direct manipulation of salient input features. This approach represents a distinct and innovative direction in the field, as confirmed by the novelty assessment.\n\nMethodology:\nThe core of the approach is the use of adversarially robust classifiers. These classifiers are trained using a robust optimization objective, which minimizes the worst-case loss over a set of small perturbations. This training process encodes priors into the model, preventing it from relying on imperceptible features and ensuring that changes in the model\\\\'s predictions correspond to salient input changes.\n\nThe authors employ a generic classification setup (ResNet-50 with default hyperparameters) without additional optimizations, highlighting the potential of the core methodology. The primary technique involves maximizing predicted class scores or individual activations using gradient descent.\n\nTechnical Details of Robust Optimization:\nThe robust optimization objective is formally defined as:\n\nE (x,y)\u223cD \\\\[max \u03b4\u2208\u2206 L(x + \u03b4, y)\\\\]\n\nwhere L is the loss function, (x,y) are data points, and \u2206 is a set of allowed perturbations. This objective is solved using adversarial training techniques.\n\nComparative Analysis and Evaluation Metrics:\nThe paper compares its approach to state-of-the-art methods for various tasks using two main evaluation metrics: Inception Score (IS) and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID).\n\n1. Image Generation: \n   - On ImageNet, the method achieves an IS of 259.0 \u00b1 4, outperforming BigGAN (233.1 \u00b1 1).\n   - On CIFAR-10, it achieves an IS of 7.5 \u00b1 0.1, compared to 9.22 for BigGAN and 8.4 \u00b1 0.1 for WGAN-GP.\n   - However, the FID score is worse than BigGAN (36.0 vs 7.4 on ImageNet).\n\nThe authors explain that their higher IS is due to the samples being essentially adversarial examples, which induce highly confident predictions. The worse FID score is attributed to GANs being explicitly trained to produce samples indistinguishable from true data, aligning well with what FID measures.\n\n2. Inpainting: The approach produces semantically meaningful reconstructions, comparable to specialized inpainting methods.\n\n3. Image-to-Image Translation: The method performs well in unpaired settings, directly modifying domain-specific characteristics.\n\n4. Super-Resolution: The approach yields sharper, more semantically meaningful reconstructions compared to traditional methods like bicubic interpolation, with a slightly higher PSNR (21.53 vs 21.30) on Restricted ImageNet.\n\nStrengths:\n1. Simplicity and Versatility: A single robust classifier can perform multiple image synthesis tasks without task-specific optimizations.\n2. Scalability: The approach benefits from scaling to larger, more complex datasets, unlike some GAN-based methods.\n3. Unpaired Translation: The method naturally handles unpaired image-to-image translation tasks.\n4. Interpretability: The approach provides insights into the features learned by robust classifiers.\n\nLimitations and Areas for Improvement:\n1. Image Quality: While competitive in many aspects, the generated images may not always match the visual quality of specialized state-of-the-art methods, particularly in terms of FID scores. Future work could focus on improving the visual quality of the generated images.\n\n2. Computational Intensity: The approach relies on gradient descent optimization, which can be computationally intensive for some applications. The authors could explore ways to optimize this process for real-time applications.\n\n3. Dependence on Classification Accuracy: The method\\\\'s performance is tied to the classifier\\\\'s ability to learn meaningful features, which may be challenging for simpler datasets. Further investigation into the relationship between classification accuracy and synthesis quality could be valuable.\n\n4. Resolution Constraints: The current implementation is limited to the resolution of the training data. Exploring techniques to generate higher-resolution outputs could enhance the method\\\\'s applicability.\n\n5. Clarity of Presentation: The abstract could be improved by explicitly mentioning specific tasks (e.g., inpainting, super-resolution) to give readers a clearer idea of the method\\\\'s capabilities. Additionally, a brief explanation of how adversarial robustness enables these diverse tasks would enhance understanding.\n\n6. Comparative Analysis: While the paper provides some comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, a more comprehensive comparative analysis across all tasks would strengthen the paper\\\\'s contributions.\n\n7. Visualization of Adversarial Robustness: The figures could be improved by including visual examples that directly illustrate the concept of adversarial robustness and its impact on image manipulation.\n\n8. Broader Implications: The paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the broader implications of using robust classifiers for image synthesis, particularly in the context of AI ethics and potential misuse of such technology.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper presents a novel and versatile approach to image synthesis using a single robust classifier. While the method shows promise in various tasks, there are opportunities for improvement in image quality, computational efficiency, and clarity of presentation. Future work could focus on addressing these limitations and exploring the broader implications of this technology in the field of computer vision and AI."]}

The proposed approach introduces a Cross Attention Module (CAM) to generate more discriminative features by highlighting relevant regions between support and query samples. Additionally, a transductive inference algorithm is proposed to alleviate the low-data issue by augmenting the support set with pseudo-labeled query samples.\n\nKey Contributions:\n1. Cross Attention Module (CAM): This module generates cross attention maps for each pair of class feature and query sample feature, highlighting target object regions and producing more discriminative features.\n\n2. Transductive Inference Algorithm: This algorithm iteratively utilizes the unlabeled query set to augment the support set, making class features more representative.\n\n3. State-of-the-art Performance: CAN achieves superior results on benchmark datasets (miniImageNet and tieredImageNet) compared to existing few-shot meta-learning approaches.\n\nMethodology:\nThe CAN framework consists of three main components:\n1. Embedding Module: A ResNet-12 network that maps input images to feature maps.\n2. Cross Attention Module: Generates attention maps to highlight relevant regions between class and query features.\n3. Classification Module: Includes a nearest neighbor classifier and a global classifier for final predictions.\n\nThe CAM operates by:\na) Computing correlation maps between class and query features\nb) Using a meta-learner to generate adaptive kernels for attention map creation\nc) Applying residual attention to weight initial feature maps\n\nThe transductive inference algorithm:\n- Predicts labels for unlabeled query samples\n- Selects high-confidence pseudo-labeled samples to augment the support set\n- Iteratively refines class representations\n\nResults:\nCAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets:\n- On miniImageNet: 63.85% (1-shot) and 79.44% (5-shot)\n- On tieredImageNet: 69.89% (1-shot) and 84.23% (5-shot)\nWith transductive inference (CAN+T), performance further improves to 67.19% (1-shot) and 80.64% (5-shot) on miniImageNet.\n\nNovelty and Significance:\nThe novelty of this work is somewhat mixed. While the cross attention mechanism and transductive inference algorithm present a novel combination for few-shot learning, similar concepts have been explored in related works. The paper\\\\'s approach to highlighting target object regions and iteratively augmenting the support set appears to be an incremental advancement rather than a fundamentally new concept in the field of few-shot learning.\n\nHowever, the integration of these elements into a cohesive framework for few-shot classification does offer a valuable contribution. The cross attention mechanism addresses the challenge of unseen classes by adaptively focusing on relevant regions, which is particularly significant for handling domain shifts between training and testing classes. The meta-learned fusion in CAM adds flexibility and adaptability to the attention generation process.\n\nThe transductive inference algorithm provides a simple yet effective way to alleviate the low-data problem, which is crucial in few-shot scenarios. Its ability to improve performance across various few-shot learning models demonstrates its generalizability and potential impact on the field.\n\nLimitations and Potential Improvements:\n1. Performance in complex scenarios: While CAN shows impressive results on benchmark datasets, its performance in more challenging real-world scenarios with significant domain shifts or highly diverse object categories could be further explored.\n\n2. Scalability: The current implementation focuses on 5-way classification tasks. Investigation into the model\\\\'s scalability to a larger number of classes would be valuable for broader applications.\n\n3. Computational efficiency: Although CAN introduces minimal overhead compared to baseline models, further optimization of the cross attention computation could potentially improve inference speed, especially for larger datasets or real-time applications.\n\n4. Hyperparameter sensitivity: The paper doesn\\\\'t extensively discuss the sensitivity of the model to various hyperparameters (e.g., temperature in attention computation, number of iterations in transductive inference).

Novelty clarification: Given the mixed assessment of novelty, the paper should more clearly articulate its specific advancements over existing attention-based and transductive approaches in few-shot learning.\n\nBroader Implications:\nThe success of CAN in few-shot learning has potential implications for various real-world applications where data scarcity is a challenge. However, the authors should be cautious in claiming significant novelty and instead focus on demonstrating the practical advantages of their integrated approach.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Cross Attention Network presents an interesting integration of attention mechanisms and transductive inference for few-shot classification, the authors should focus on highlighting its practical improvements and real-world applicability rather than emphasizing novelty. Future work could address the limitations noted above to further advance the field of few-shot learning."]}

The authors propose a novel method called transition-revision (T-Revision) that effectively learns transition matrices without relying on anchor points, leading to improved classifiers. This contribution is significant as it challenges the prevailing notion that anchor points are indispensable in label-noise learning.\n\nMain Contribution:\nThe paper\\\\'s primary contribution is the T-Revision method, which enables effective learning of transition matrices without the need for anchor points. This approach maintains the efficacy of consistent algorithms even in scenarios where anchor point assumptions are violated, thus expanding the applicability of label-noise learning techniques to a broader range of real-world problems.\n\nDetailed Explanation of T-Revision:\nThe T-Revision method operates in two stages:\n1. Initialization: The transition matrix is initialized using data points that are similar to anchor points, having high noisy class posterior probabilities.\n2. Modification: The initialized matrix is then modified by adding a slack variable, which is learned and validated together with the classifier using only noisy data.\n\nThe authors employ a deep-learning-based risk-consistent estimator to tune the transition matrix accurately. This estimator is designed to converge to the classification risk with respect to clean data as the size of noisy training examples increases.\n\nNon-Technical Explanation of Generalization Error:\nThe generalization error refers to how well the model performs on unseen data compared to its performance on the training data. In this paper, the authors provide theoretical justification for the T-Revision method by deriving a generalization bound. This bound demonstrates that the difference between the model\\\\'s performance on the training set and its expected performance on new, unseen data is likely to be small, especially as the training sample size increases.\n\nAdvancement in Label-Noise Learning:\nThis paper advances the field of label-noise learning by:\n1. Challenging the necessity of anchor points, which were previously considered crucial.\n2. Providing a method that maintains the effectiveness of consistent algorithms even when anchor points are absent.\n3. Introducing a risk-consistent estimator that doesn\\\\'t involve the inverse of the transition matrix, addressing a common issue in previous approaches.\n4. Demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially in scenarios with high label noise.\n\nImplications of Experimental Results:\nThe experimental results show that:\n1. The T-Revision method significantly outperforms existing approaches, especially on datasets with high label noise.\n2. The method is effective on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets, including the challenging Clothing1M dataset.\n3. The approach leads to more accurate estimation of transition matrices, which explains its superior classification performance.\n4. The method remains effective even when potential anchor points are removed from the datasets, demonstrating its robustness.\n\nThese results imply that the T-Revision method could be widely applicable in real-world scenarios where label noise is prevalent and anchor points may not be available or reliable.\n\nComputational Efficiency:\nThe paper demonstrates that the T-Revision method is computationally efficient compared to alternatives like cross-validation. It does not require trying different parameter combinations, making it more practical for large-scale applications.\n\nLimitations and Future Research:\nWhile the paper presents significant advancements, there are some limitations and areas for future research:\n1. The method currently doesn\\\\'t incorporate prior knowledge about the transition matrix (e.g., sparsity). Future work could explore how to integrate such priors into the learning system.\n2. The paper doesn\\\\'t extensively explore the recursive learning of the transition matrix and classifier, which could potentially lead to further improvements.\n3. The theoretical analysis could be extended to provide tighter bounds on the generalization error.\n\nCritical Analysis:\nThe paper\\\\'s assumptions and methodology appear sound, but a few points warrant further consideration:\n1. The definition of \"anchor points\" is generalized in this paper, which may affect comparisons with previous work.\n2. The method\\\\'s performance on datasets with extremely imbalanced class distributions or with instance-dependent label noise is not extensively"], "multi_agent_with_knowledge": ["Here is the revised comprehensive peer review for the paper \\\"Are Anchor Points Really Indispensable in Label-Noise Learning?\\\", incorporating the novelty assessment and figure critic feedback:\n\nTitle: Are Anchor Points Really Indispensable in Label-Noise Learning?\n\nSummary:\nThis paper presents an approach to label-noise learning that aims to learn transition matrices without relying on anchor points, which are typically considered essential in existing methods. The authors propose a transition-revision (T-Revision) method that initializes the transition matrix using data points with high noisy class posterior probabilities, then modifies it by adding a learnable slack variable. This approach is claimed to lead to better classifiers and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art label-noise learning methods.\n\nStrengths:\n1. The paper addresses an important limitation in current label-noise learning methods by proposing a technique that does not rely on anchor points. This extends the applicability of label-noise learning to scenarios where anchor points may not exist or are difficult to identify.\n\n2. The authors provide a theoretical foundation for their approach, including a risk-consistent estimator and a generalization error bound, which strengthens the credibility of the proposed method.\n\n3. The paper includes extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the T-Revision method across various scenarios and noise levels.\n\n4. The proposed method shows promising performance on real-world applications, as demonstrated by its results on the Clothing1M dataset, which contains naturally noisy labels.\n\n5. The paper includes well-designed figures that effectively illustrate key concepts and results, such as the sensitivity of current methods to accurate transition matrix estimation and an overview of the proposed T-Revision method.\n\nLimitations and Potential Improvements:\n1. Novelty: The novelty of the proposed method is questionable. Several existing papers have already addressed the challenge of learning without anchor points in label-noise scenarios. For example, the paper \\\"Clusterability as an Alternative to Anchor Points When Learning with Noisy Labels\\\" proposes a clusterability-based approach to overcome the limitations of anchor points. The T-Revision method, while different in specifics, appears to be tackling the same fundamental problem with a similar high-level approach.\n\n2. Comparison with existing methods: The paper would benefit from a more thorough comparison with existing anchor-free methods, particularly those mentioned in the novelty assessment. This would help to clearly differentiate the proposed method and highlight its unique contributions.\n\n3. Computational complexity: The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the computational complexity or runtime comparisons with other methods. This information would be valuable for practitioners considering the adoption of this technique.\n\n4. Hyperparameter sensitivity: There is no discussion on the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameters or guidelines for hyperparameter selection. This information would be crucial for reproducing results and applying the method to new datasets.\n\n5. Scalability: While the method shows performance on datasets up to 100 classes (CIFAR-100), it would be interesting to see how it scales to even larger datasets with more classes or higher-dimensional feature spaces.\n\n6. Ablation studies: The paper would benefit from more detailed ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components of the T-Revision method, such as the initialization strategy and the slack variable learning process.\n\nConstructive Criticism:\n1. Clarity and consistency: The abstract and figure captions could be better aligned. The abstract should mention specific datasets used in the empirical results (e.g., MNIST, Clothing1M) to provide a clearer picture of the experimental setup. Additionally, the abstract should briefly explain the different method variations (-A, -R, -N/A) mentioned in the table captions.\n\n2. Visual representation: While Figure 2 provides an overview of the proposed method, it could be improved by adding labels to the components to more clearly illustrate the T-Revision method. Consider incorporating visual representations of the transition matrix and slack variable to better align with the abstract\\\\'s description.\n\n3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed method and potential failure cases. This would provide a more balanced view of the technique and help readers understand when it might not be appropriate to use.\n\n4. The explanation of why the T-Revision method works well even when there are anchor points (Section 4.1) could be expanded. A more in-depth analysis of this phenomenon would provide valuable insights into the method\\\\'s robustness.\n\n5. The paper could include a discussion on the interpretability of the learned transition matrices and slack variables. This could provide insights into the nature of the label noise in different datasets and potentially lead to new avenues for research.\n\n6. While the paper focuses on class-dependent and instance-independent transition matrices, it would be interesting to discuss how the method might be extended to handle instance-dependent label noise, which is often more realistic in practical scenarios.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting approach to label-noise learning without anchor points, its novelty and contributions to the field are less significant than initially claimed. The authors should focus on clearly differentiating their method from existing anchor-free approaches and provide a more comprehensive comparison to establish its advantages. Improving the clarity and consistency between the abstract, figures, and main text would also enhance the paper\\\\'s overall quality and impact."]}

In a real peer review situation, each section would contain detailed, paper-specific comments and examples drawn directly from the manuscript under review."], "multi_agent_with_knowledge": ["Review of \\\"Inducing brain-relevant bias in natural language processing models\\\"\n\nThis paper presents an innovative approach to aligning natural language processing models with human brain activity during language processing. The authors demonstrate that fine-tuning BERT, a powerful language model, to predict brain activity recorded through fMRI and MEG can lead to representations that encode more brain-activity-relevant language information. This study makes significant contributions to both neuroscience and natural language processing fields, opening new avenues for understanding language processing in the brain and improving NLP models.\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. Novelty: The study introduces a novel method of fine-tuning NLP models using neuroimaging data, bridging the gap between computational models of language and neuroscientific understanding of language processing. This approach is distinct from existing work in the field, as it directly adapts AI models to align with brain representations of language.\n\n2. Cross-participant generalization: The authors demonstrate that the relationship between text and brain activity learned by the fine-tuned model generalizes across multiple participants, suggesting that the model captures universal aspects of language processing in the brain.\n\n3. Cross-modal transfer: The study shows that for some participants, training on MEG data before fine-tuning on fMRI data improved predictions, especially in language areas. This indicates that the model is learning generalizable representations of language processing that are not specific to a single imaging modality.\n\n4. Preservation of NLP capabilities: Importantly, the fine-tuned models maintained or slightly improved their performance on standard NLP tasks (GLUE benchmark), demonstrating that inducing brain-relevant bias does not compromise general language understanding capabilities.\n\n5. Comprehensive analysis: The paper includes detailed analyses of changes in model representations, including attention mechanisms and potential changes in motion-related representations.\n\n6. Clear methodology: The authors provide a clear and detailed description of their experimental setup, data preprocessing, and evaluation metrics, facilitating reproducibility and future research in this direction.\n\nLimitations and areas for improvement:\n\n1. Sample size: The study uses a relatively small sample size (9 participants for fMRI, 8 for MEG), which limits the generalizability of the findings. Future work should aim to include a larger and more diverse participant pool.\n\n2. Limited text corpus: The experiments use only one chapter from \\\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\\\'s Stone\\\" as the stimulus. Expanding to a wider range of texts could provide a more comprehensive assessment of the model\\\\'s language processing capabilities.\n\n3. Lack of control conditions: The study could benefit from including control conditions, such as models fine-tuned on non-brain data or randomly shuffled brain data, to isolate the specific effects of brain-activity fine-tuning.\n\n4. Limited exploration of model architectures: While the focus on BERT is well-justified, exploring how different model architectures perform could provide insights into which aspects of the models are most relevant for capturing brain-activity-relevant language information.\n\n5. Temporal resolution mismatch: The approach to addressing the temporal mismatch between fMRI and language processing (using a 20-word window) could be refined to better capture the dynamic nature of language processing.\n\n6. Limited behavioral measures: Incorporating behavioral measures of language comprehension could help establish links between model performance, brain activity, and actual language understanding.\n\n7. Clarity of visual representations: The figures provided could be improved to better align with the key points emphasized in the abstract. For example, including a schematic that shows the overall workflow from fine-tuning to brain activity prediction and NLP task performance would help tie together the various components mentioned in the abstract.\n\n8. Accessibility of technical information: The captions for the figures are quite dense and technical. Simplifying the language or providing brief explanations of key terms could improve accessibility for a broader audience, given the potentially interdisciplinary nature of this research.\n\nRecommendations for future work:\n\n1. Expand the participant pool and text corpus to improve generalizability.\n2. Include control conditions to isolate the specific effects of brain-activity fine-tuning.\n3. Explore variations in model architecture and compare with other language models.\n4. Develop more sophisticated methods for aligning temporal dynamics of language input with brain activity.\n5. Conduct more extensive probing of fine-tuned models to understand representational changes.\n6. Investigate how the fine-tuned models capture individual differences in language processing.\n7. Further explore the potential of joint training (MEG + fMRI), as it shows promise but currently doesn\\\\'t outperform individually trained models.\n8. Consider the ethical implications and potential applications of brain-activity-biased language models, discussing both benefits and potential risks.\n9. Improve visual representations to better illustrate key concepts, such as the cross-modality benefits of MEG and fMRI data.\n10. Enhance the accessibility of technical information in figure captions to reach a broader interdisciplinary audience.\n\nImpact and contribution:\n\nThis paper makes a substantial contribution to both NLP and neuroscience. It introduces a novel method for aligning computational language models with human brain activity, demonstrates the effectiveness and generalizability of this approach, and opens up numerous avenues for future research. The potential applications span from improved understanding of human language processing to the development of more brain-like AI systems. The study\\\\'s findings have significant implications for advancing our understanding of the relationship between artificial and biological language processing systems."]}

The authors propose ZS3Net, a deep learning architecture that combines visual segmentation with generative modeling of class embeddings to enable pixel-wise classification of both seen and unseen object categories.\n\nNovelty and Contribution:\nThe primary contribution of this work is the introduction of zero-shot semantic segmentation as a new research problem. This is a significant advancement in the field of computer vision, as it addresses the scalability limitations of current semantic segmentation models when faced with a large number of object classes. The authors\\\\' approach of combining deep visual segmentation with generative modeling of word embeddings is both innovative and effective.\n\nMethodology:\nThe ZS3Net architecture consists of three main components:\n1. A backbone deep network for image embedding (DeepLabv3+)\n2. A generative model (GMMN) for synthesizing visual features from semantic word embeddings\n3. A classification layer that can handle both seen and unseen classes\n\nThe authors also introduce a self-training step (ZS5Net) to improve performance when unlabeled pixels from unseen classes are available during training. Additionally, they propose a graph-context encoding method to leverage spatial context priors in complex scenes.\n\nGenerative Approach:\nThe core of the ZS3Net\\\\'s zero-shot learning capability lies in its generative approach. By using a Generative Moment Matching Network (GMMN), the model learns to generate synthetic visual features conditioned on semantic word embeddings. This allows the model to produce plausible feature representations for unseen classes, enabling their recognition during inference. The generative component is crucial for bridging the gap between seen and unseen classes in the feature space.\n\nExperimental Evaluation:\nThe authors provide a comprehensive evaluation of their approach on two standard datasets: Pascal-VOC and Pascal-Context. They consider various zero-shot setups with different numbers of unseen classes (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). The results demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline method across all metrics, particularly for unseen classes. The inclusion of self-training and graph-context encoding further boosts performance, especially in complex scenes.\n\nLimitations:\nWhile the paper presents impressive results, there are some limitations to consider:\n1. The approach relies heavily on the quality of word embeddings, which may not always capture the visual characteristics of objects accurately.\n2. The performance gap between seen and unseen classes is still noticeable, especially as the number of unseen classes increases.\n3. The method\\\\'s effectiveness on datasets with a larger number of classes or more fine-grained categories remains to be explored.\n\nComparative Analysis:\nThe paper could benefit from a more extensive comparison with other zero-shot learning tasks, such as zero-shot image classification or object detection. This would help contextualize the challenges specific to zero-shot semantic segmentation and highlight the unique aspects of the proposed solution.\n\nFuture Research Directions:\nSeveral promising avenues for future research emerge from this work:\n1. Exploring more sophisticated generative models or alternative ways to synthesize visual features for unseen classes.\n2. Investigating methods to reduce the performance gap between seen and unseen classes, especially for larger numbers of unseen categories.\n3. Extending the approach to handle a continual learning scenario, where new classes are incrementally added over time.\n4. Developing techniques to make the model less dependent on the quality of word embeddings, possibly by incorporating other forms of semantic information.\n\nReal-world Applicability and Challenges:\nThe proposed zero-shot semantic segmentation approach has potential applications in various domains, such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and augmented reality. However, several challenges need to be addressed for real-world deployment:\n1. Robustness to domain shift and out-of-distribution samples\n2. Computational efficiency for real-time applications\n3.

The authors present a method that addresses several limitations of existing NAS techniques while achieving state-of-the-art performance on various image classification tasks.\n\nNovelty:\nThe paper presents a significantly novel approach to neural architecture search. The application of the theory of prediction with expert advice to NAS is a unique contribution that sets this work apart from existing methods. The XNAS method introduces an innovative optimization criterion focused on minimizing regret and dynamically adjusting architectures, along with the use of multiple learning rates based on gradient information. These methodological innovations demonstrate a clear advancement over previous approaches in the field.\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. Theoretical Foundation: XNAS provides a strong theoretical basis for NAS, framing it as an online selection task and leveraging PEA theory. This approach offers optimal worst-case regret bounds, addressing the lack of principled methods in many NAS techniques.\n\n2. Novel Optimization Method: The paper introduces a unique optimization approach using the Exponentiated Gradient (EG) algorithm with a wipeout mechanism. This method dynamically eliminates inferior architectures during the search process, potentially reducing bias in the final architecture selection.\n\n3. State-of-the-Art Performance: XNAS achieves impressive results across multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10 (1.60% error rate), ImageNet, and others, demonstrating its effectiveness and transferability.\n\n4. Efficiency: With a search cost of only 0.3 GPU days for CIFAR-10, XNAS is among the fastest existing NAS methods, making it more accessible for researchers with limited computational resources.\n\n5. Robustness: The method shows greater robustness to initialization compared to gradient descent with softmax, addressing a common issue in NAS setups.\n\n6. Fewer Hyperparameters: XNAS simplifies the search process by reducing the number of hyperparameters that need tuning, potentially making it more reliable and easier to use.\n\nLimitations and Suggestions for Improvement:\n\n1. Limited Ablation Studies: While the paper provides theoretical justifications for various components, more comprehensive ablation studies would help understand the contribution of each component to the overall performance.\n\n2. Comparison with Random Search: Given recent criticisms that some NAS methods perform only slightly better than random search, a direct comparison with random search baselines would strengthen the paper\\\\'s claims.\n\n3. Broader Application: The paper focuses primarily on image classification tasks. Exploring the application of XNAS to other domains (e.g., natural language processing, reinforcement learning) could demonstrate its versatility and broader impact.\n\n4. Interpretability: While the method provides theoretical insights, improving the interpretability of the selected architectures could be valuable for practitioners and could provide further insights into why certain architectures perform well.\n\n5. Sensitivity Analysis: A more detailed analysis of the method\\\\'s sensitivity to various hyperparameters (e.g., the wipeout threshold) would be helpful for practitioners implementing XNAS.\n\n6. Long-term Performance: Investigation into the long-term performance and stability of the discovered architectures beyond the reported number of epochs could provide valuable insights into their generalization capabilities.\n\n7. Computational Efficiency Analysis: While XNAS is reported to be fast, a more thorough comparison of search times and resource requirements with other state-of-the-art methods would be beneficial.\n\n8. Visual Representation: The figures and tables presented in the paper could be improved to better illustrate key concepts:\n   - The connection between the algorithm steps and the concepts mentioned in the abstract (e.g., regret minimization, dynamic wiping out of inferior architectures) is not immediately clear from the provided figures.\n   - A visual representation of how the method \\\"dynamically wipes out inferior architectures and enhances superior ones\\\" would enhance understanding.\n   - The multiple learning rates mentioned in the abstract are not visibly represented in the diagrams.\n   - Consider adding a flowchart or diagram illustrating the connection between the optimization method and image classification performance.\n\n9.

In particular, they derive an explicit density function p(x) where the likelihood can be evaluated, the corresponding components p(x|z) are more flexible than the standard VAE that utilizes diagonal Gaussians, and the generated samples have better quality than a standard VAE. The basic idea of the proposed model is that the VAE is defined between a latent space and an intermediate representation space, and then, the representation space is connected with the data space through an invertible non-linear flow.   In general, I think the paper is quite well written, but on the same time I believe that there is a lot of compressed information, and the consequence is that in some parts it is not even clear what the authors want to say (see Clarity comments). The proposed idea of the paper seems quite interesting, but on the same time I have some doubts (see Quality comments).  Clarity: 1. My main concern is that a lot of information is presented in a compressed way. For example, in Sec. 3 the general drawbacks of the VAEs and GANs are presented, and later in Sec. 4 a potential solution is provided. However, I think that is not crystal clear from the text how the proposed method solves these problems. For instance, one of the basic ideas is that the proposed method intuitively produces more flexible components p(x|z), such that to pull the density towards the image manifold. This is the main improvement upon the VAE, however, this is not mentioned clearly in the text. In general, I believe that the text is a bit \\\"wordy\\\", and instead, it should be more \\\"to the point\\\". 2. The term \\\"strictly proper\\\" is introduced but not used later in the text (line 102). 3. In my opinion the Fig. 1 & Fig. 2 are not so informative. 4. In Eq. 2 I think the p_\\theta(x) is missed in the begging. Also, in Eq. 5 real data should not be used during the training of the discriminator? 5. In line 196 the optimal discriminator is refereed to Eq. 5, but this is not clear from the text. 6. In line 201, the two KL divergences are not symmetric, but the sum of them is. 7. The invertible function is not discussed in the main paper at all. Of course, information is provided in the appendix, but since the main paper should be \\\"standalone\\\" and the invertible function is a fundamental component of the method, I think that some discussion should be included. 8. In the Table 3 (MLE), how the BPD of NVP, VAE-IAF, Glow are computed, since for the IS and FID you use some symbols that refer to notes. 9. What the $\\times$ means in Table 4? Also, what the LSUN table shows? 10. The NVP is the same with Real-NVP? Because both names are used. 11. I think that in the discussion of the experiments, the reasons and the intuition should be stated that explain why the proposed method is better than the competitive methods. In my opinion the current discussion does not explain the benefits of the proposed method.   Quality: To my understanding, the basic idea of the paper is to define a VAE between a latent space and a representation space, and then connect the representation space with the data space through an invertible non-linear function f. Then, an adversarial training is applied to improve the sample quality.  1. I think that the goal of this approach is to construct more expressive/flexible p(x|z), which will pull the pdf mass closer to the data manifold. Instead, the diagonal Gaussian puts a lot of pdf mass outside of the data manifold due to the conditional independence assumption and the actual non-linear structure of the data manifold locally. So if an adversarial training is applied, the diagonal Gaussian constraint of the standard VAE will \\\"regularize\\\" to some extend the mu(z) and this will not improve the samples. While, using the proposed method with the flexible p(x|z), the mass can be pulled easier towards the manifold using the adversarial training. Is this explanation correct? If yes, then this makes sense, however from the text this is not communicated properly. 2. My main concern is that the method seems to be very similar to the Real-NVP. In particular, I do not see where the middle representation helps. Since, simply a Real-NVP can be used, which will produce a complex p(x) potentially closer to the image manifold, and then the adversarial training could be utilized to improve the quality of the samples. In particular, in Eq. 5 the f^-1(\\\\mu(z)) can be seen essentially just as an NVP flow. So the question is: why the proposed method is better than a Real-NVP with an additional adversarial training? 3. In the Abstract is mentioned that the proposed method \\\"is more efficient than fully invertible models\\\". Why is this the case? I think that the representation space and the image space have the same dimensionality, so the invertible function will have the same size as other flow models. Based on my comment 2, why your method is more efficient than a Real-NVP with an additional adversarial training? Since the proposed model needs additionally to the invertible non-linear function f the mean and variance functions of the VAE encoder and decoder. So there are more parameters to be trained.   Originality: The related work is cited properly. As the authors state, the combination of VAE with GANs is not a new idea. Of course, the proposed trick with the intermediate stochastic representation seems to be novel. However, as I commented in Quality, I am not sure how essential is the difference between the proposed approach and a Real-NVP with an additional adversarial training.   Significance: The experimental results follow the proposed theory. In particular, in Sec. 5.1 is shown how each component of the method helps i.e. the flow improves the likelihood, the adversarial training the sampling quality and both of them together. Also, compared to other similar and state of the art models, the proposed model achieves higher log-likelihoods and improved sampling quality. However, I think that a good baseline experiment is the Real-NVP including the adversarial training, because in my opinion this is the closest model. Moreover, I would like to see some toy examples that present the p(x) differences between a VAE and the proposed model, as well as the differences between the p(f(x)) and the prior p(z)? In particular, I would like to see if the p(f(x)) learns indeed a useful representation, or if it is similar to a Gaussian."], "barebones": ["Here are the key points from the experimental results and comparison to the state-of-the-art on CIFAR-10:\n\n1.
