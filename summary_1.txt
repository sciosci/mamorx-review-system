The first part of the paper presents the motivation and contributions of the implicit MAML (iMAML) algorithm in the context of few-shot learning and meta-learning. The authors introduce iMAML as a solution to overcome computational and memory burdens associated with gradient-based meta-learning, particularly the need to differentiate through the inner loop learning process.

The general approach involves learning meta-parameters in an outer loop while adapting task-specific models in the inner loop with minimal data. Traditional methods like MAML require differentiating through the entire optimization path, which is computationally expensive. iMAML, however, leverages implicit differentiation to compute accurate meta-gradients based only on the solution of the inner level optimization, significantly reducing memory requirements and computational costs.

Theoretical contributions of iMAML include proving that it can compute meta-gradients with minimal memory footprint and without increased computational cost. Experimentally, iMAML shows empirical gains on few-shot image recognition benchmarks. The proximal regularization approach within iMAML ensures that task-specific parameters remain closely dependent on meta-parameters, thus avoiding issues like vanishing gradients.
